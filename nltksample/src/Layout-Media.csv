Jeremy Lin has dribbled America into the previously quiet corner of its casual prejudice and lazy stereotypes of Asian Americans.  The true beauty of his story is in awareness of the ugliness that has been found there.  It's been barely two weeks since the beginning of a tale that rocked the sports world with great basketball and bad puns, but so much already has changed. When America now looks at Lin, it should see more than an Asian American kid from Harvard who overcame ignorance at every level to become a star guard for the New York Knicks.  America should see itself in the murky reflection of a society that has long considered it reasonable to publicly categorize Asian Americans in ways that would never be acceptable for other, more vocal minorities.  America should see the writer from Foxsports.com who began the barrage of ignorance last week by tweeting a tired joke about the assumed size of Lin's manhood. The guy apologized, but his company did not, which should not be surprising considering Fox Sports is also the outfit that last fall aired a segment in which a reporter ridiculed Asian Americans at USC for not understanding football.  Can you imagine a major American media company tolerating this sort of blatant racism if it were directed toward any of Lin's African American teammates?  America should see the game video from the Knicks' MSG network in which cameras focused on a homemade sign that showed Lin's face above a fortune cookie with the words, ""The Knicks Good Fortune.''  Can you imagine, five months from now, that same television director willingly airing a shot of a sign that made fun of the heritage of a Latino member of the New York Mets?  If America has the stomach, it should even watch the tape of the WNYW morning show in New York where one of the anchors, upon hearing a reporter list Lin's physical attributes, asked, ""What about his eyes?""  The newsman made the slur, he sort of winked with glee, the entire news desk laughed and I'm thinking, you're kidding me, right? In a media world that is reluctant to even cite a subject's ethnicity unless it is relevant, it's suddenly OK to openly laugh about Lin's cultural characteristics because, well, because he's Asian American and everybody does it?  ""In this country, Asian Americans are stereotyped as the meek and the mild, the ones who will always take the racism,"" said Daryl Maeda, an associate professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado who specializes in Asian American studies. ''There is a perception that it's OK to offend Asian Americans because they simply won't fight back.''  There was finally push-back last weekend at ESPN, which fired one employee and suspended another for separately describing the Knicks' first loss with Lin as a starter as a ""Chink in the armor.""  The guy who was fired amazingly felt confident enough to put it in a mobile website headline. The guy who was suspended said it on the air during a conversation, and it seemed impulsive enough that he was probably just throwing out a clichÃ© without thinking.  In marginalizing the Jeremy Lin story, that newsman actually illustrated its real importance. This newfound basketball force has forced Americans to take a deep breath and think. He has forced America to realize it has become too comfortable compartmentalizing Asian Americans with a list of stereotypes that are misguided, mean-spirited and just plain wrong.  Such as that one that says, you know, they can't play sports.  ""The one thing I think is interesting about this whole Jeremy Linsanity is that it has forced us to think about how we think and talk about race in general,'' Maeda said. ""Asian Americans have long been put into this safe little slot, and Jeremy has taken us out of those places.''  This is what sports does. This is one reason sports matters. Through the shared understanding of the human condition that so publicly exists in sports, society is often forced into self-realization and change, and where else can that happen?  America really needs to watch the ""Saturday Night Live'' skit in which three sports reporters laughingly discuss Lin while using Asian American slurs, yet when a fourth newsman tries to discuss other Knicks by using African American slurs, they become offended.  ""This all shows how Asian Americans have long been the invisible minority,'' Maeda said.  Not right now, not in NBA's biggest city, as the most celebrated Asian American in league history is in the backcourt for one of the NBA's marquee teams, in the center of what could end up being the sports story of the year.  Jeremy Lin's heritage is a wonderful part of this story and should not be ignored. But can't we do that without being ignorant?</SPAN></P>",0,"2012-05-25 05:11:47"

The camera had panned lovingly on Jeremy Linâ€™s face throughout the game, even, maybe especially when he wasnâ€™t playingâ€”he was the go-to reaction shot. It was as if the whole game was in his POV. He remained goofy if also focused, a kind of playful skittering energy coming off him on the bench, as if he just wanted to get back out there. Now it was the end, the team had won again, seven straight wins in a row. As the interview with him paused, a picture of a giant fortune cookie with his face in the middle, his now-trademark blue tongue sticking out, and a banner written like a Fortune Cookie read â€œKnicks Good Fortune.â€  I thought of his grandmother in Taiwan watching from home, and hoped she just laughed. I was in a shocked silence. Iâ€™d gone to a bar near my house to watch it. No one else had reacted, or if they did, they were in a shocked silence too. The three nice older white women near me who had been affectionately watching each time Lin came on kept glancing over, for one more shot.  When I thought about it, it was the kind of thing I hoped wasnâ€™t going to happen. What made it worse was that they were panning to the cheering Asian fans still holding up their giant signs made from pictures of his head, shaking them as the camera passed over them.  We were no longer in Jeremyâ€™s POV.  ***  In the first two days, just after February 4, 2012, for most of us, Lin was a thirty-second whirl on a YouTube clip and a basketball arena full of people cheering, a status update from someone you didnâ€™t know cared about basketball, a headline that didnâ€™t quite mean anything to you until it did and then you thought â€œThis kid is everywhere.â€ This kid. 6â€™3â€, 200 lbs., a great smile, like he was having the best time ever. There were nicknames, headlines, blog posts that began â€œI donâ€™t normally write about sports/care about basketball/donâ€™t want to seem like another Asian guy/girl who loves this guy butâ€ . . . Yes. But-but-but-but. It just kept coming, there were all these games being played that very next week. By Day 3 you could already get a Fathead decal of him for your room, as big as the wall, and by Thursday, Day 5, Spike Lee was seeking nominations on his Twitter feed for a new nickname for this kid, and for four hours he tweeted his favorites. He decided a winner but who knows if anyone uses it, no disrespect to Spike, because by then that was a leaf in a storm. Just on Twitter alone, for example, where people often go to ask questions of the Internet that they wonâ€™t Google, the gamut ran from â€œWhyâ€™s everyone talking about this guy?â€ to â€œWho is this guyâ€ to â€œ#LINSANITY [Enter score sports move praise here] [SOMETHING IN ALL CAPS HERE].â€ (All caps made a comeback in the last year, but never did you notice more than now.)  A forest of columns and blog posts appeared as everyone ran something of an op-ed about him. He was link-bait, like-bait, there were encomiums and paeans and stats, followed by dismissals, which were then followed by more games, more scoring, more YouTube videos, followed by more praise, more doubters. Memes. People were fighting pro-Lin/con-Lin like they were Democrats and Republicans and this was Bush vs. Gore. There was a FOX Sports commentator Tweet scandal followed by a demand for an apology and then the apology came, there was Magic Johnson on SportsCenter talking down a naysayer, explaining the elements of his technique (Shorter Magic: he reads the defense like one of those books he plays at opening before games, and then he walks through the holes).  By then it was the Lakers, the big time, Kobe Bryant saying â€œWhoâ€™s this kidâ€ and then finding out. It was the fourth game of the Linsanity. The next night the Knicks played the Timberwolves, where no one reported the booing you can hear if you listen hard, and they tried to hobble him. By the time he left the court, he told the New York Times reporter afterward, â€œIâ€™m just a little numb. I canâ€™t feel my legs right now.â€ But he still made a final free-throw shot that helped the team take home another win.  He had two days off till the next game, but it didnâ€™t matter. The Linsanity didnâ€™t care, doesnâ€™t care, it doesnâ€™t care what you want, it doesnâ€™t care if you love him or hate him, it doesnâ€™t care if heâ€™s even playing because come on, YouTube, and here is a blog post about his new apartment, itâ€™s bigger than you and it doesnâ€™t care that you resent that part of it tooâ€”no one canâ€™t stop it. You can play him on NBA 2K12 (though maybe wait until the update, due out tomorrow), read the â€œHey Girlâ€ Ryan Gosling meme now starring Jeremy Lin, you can make a sign, like the fangirl who held up a Linderella poster with a cut-out for her face as the camera swept the Garden. And the whole time, we all think we know him: Asian Americans, Asian American Christians, Christians, Asian American Sports fans, Sports fans, Knicks fans, people who are just nice, also the mean ones, the nasty ones, the haters and the racists and the â€˜if heâ€™s famous in a week Iâ€™m a hater automaticallyâ€™ crowd, they are all trying to tag him, it is like watching everyone come off the bleachers, all over America, and rush this one kid to hug him or put him on their shoulders or hold him down.  Also China, Taiwan and the Phillippines, who added Knicks games to their markets on the third morning of the Linsanity. They came off the benches too. China decided he was Chinese. Taiwan was all â€œNot so fast,â€ but as Deadspin put it, â€œToo bad yâ€™all. Heâ€™s â€™murican.â€™â€  Meanwhile, somewhere on Wall Street, MSGâ€™s stock price rose six percent that week to an all-time highâ€”as CNBC reporter Darren Rovell Tweeted, MSGâ€™s market cap has grown $228 million since February 4, during which time they paid Lin just $48,100, which means he brought them a 474,000-percent return on their money that week. What kind of bonus do you get on that? Also? That Knicks/Timberwolves game Lin played in had the highest Nielsen rating of any Knicks game in a year.  If you look, just beyond the rings of videos of him leaping and leaping again to his Megastardom, you can find a YouTube channel for him. Most people have not found this, because there are just 74,000  subscribers as of today, though that number has been growing at a rate of 5k per day since I first checked it last Saturday. The page features a logo sure to be on a sneaker by next Monday, probably. There are a few video diaries of him, hanging out with friends and training like a maniac all day. â€œDay 1â€ starts with a flash of his abs as he dramatically, self-mockingly, gets out of bed in his basketball shorts, eats an enormous Dennyâ€™s breakfast with a T-bone and eggs and potatoes, chooses his sneakers from the rows neatly lined up in his car trunk, and then there are the weights, the drills, a change of clothes, a handful of t-shirts wrung out in the parking lot as the cameraman skeeves out. It was made back when he wasnâ€™t particularly famous and mocks itself some even as it is also sincere for the fansâ€”and when you see how he trains, you understand how the skinny kid is strong.  The self-mocking reaches perfection in a hilarious confession that he failed his first driverâ€™s test for driving too slow. Hilarious because of the Asians canâ€™t drive thing and of course one of the Top Linsanity Tweets is â€œWHO SAYS ASIANS CANâ€™T DRIVE?â€ Heâ€™s SNL-ready (come on SNLâ€”you know you want this Jeremy Lin driving skit), but heâ€™s also just a good-looking goofy kid with a big smile on his face who is much stronger than you think, looking like he is having more fun than anyone on the court except maybe his team-mates. And it may be as easy as this, to understand whatâ€™s happening.  For years, fans have been mourning the lack of a love of the game at the pro level, tired of the unsmiling giant millionaire players with tattoos like MMA fighters, epic scandals and no ability to get the fans roaring on their feet. Many had gone back to college ball to remember the love of the game, sick of the epic ticket costs and the cable premium charges and now the cable company battles. It may be that the biggest part of whatâ€™s happening is that itâ€™s just great, just plain great, to see someone smiling his way down the court, and not like a dope, but like the guy whoâ€™s about to go around you to the hoopâ€”and get there.     ***  Thereâ€™s a light coming off that giant horrible Fortune Cookie, and in it, you can see there are two games Lin is playing and winningâ€”one is basketball, the other is the game the American media complex plays in making you think X about Asians. Winning one wins the otherâ€”he makes changing the world look as easy as playing ball. All that sad bullshit coming after him, the Jason Whitlock jokes, the â€œheâ€™s just getting attention because heâ€™s Asianâ€ stuff, the Fortune Cookie graphics, itâ€™s all an attempt to put him back in his place, back behind the curtain, to make sure he doesnâ€™t really appear. And itâ€™s too late. Many people were making money off of the way things used to beâ€”now they are making money off of the new way. Something in the power of his game has tipped the balance and the kid is money now, literallyâ€”he has the ratings on his side, the web traffic, the new army of fans, his team. This isnâ€™t an equal opportunity hire, no one at the Knicks did this to be nice to Asian peopleâ€”the fortune cookie proves that. No, the people in the Skybox are getting paid. Lin has managed to make something bigger than their bullshit and heâ€™s riding it out from behind the stage. And a month from now will be the first spring all the coaches in America go through their teams one more time for the Asian kid they missed. Theyâ€™ll never miss him again. </SPAN></P>",0,"2012-05-25 05:11:47"

One of the Grosvenor Square memorial service attendees, who did not want to be named, said the protesters should be stopped from standing just across the road from the embassy and using a loud megaphone.  The man, whose cousin died in the terror attacks, said: ""They shouldn't be allowed to do it. It's very disrespectful. It's too loud.""  He added: ""They can say what they want but not with the loudspeaker.""  Earlier a group of right-wing English Defence League protesters, who had gathered in response to the demonstration, were ordered to move on to accommodate the MAC supporters.

Now, a new study says that the view of Africa as a basket case is wrong.  As the continent prepares to welcome thousands of international football fans for the World Cup in June, it seems the image of an economically vibrant region the hosts are keen to project is closer to the truth than tired stereotypes suggest.  Xavier Sala-i-Martin and Maxim Pinkovskiy, two US-based academics, find that in the 10 years before the credit crunch began, poverty rates fell rapidly and inequality declined right across the continent.  They say that it is time to stop feeling so gloomy about the prospects for Africa, which they claim may meet the Millennium Development Goal target, of halving the number of people living on $1 a day, ahead of the 2015 deadline.  ""Our results show that the conventional wisdom that Africa is not reducing poverty is wrong. In fact, since 1995, African poverty has been falling steadily,"" the authors say. ""Moreover, contrary to the commonly held idea that African growth is largely based on natural resources and helps only the rich and well-connected, we show that a great deal of this growth has accrued to the poor.""  The findings in the report, published by America's National Bureau of Economic Research, contradict the views of the World Bank and the United Nations, which established the millennium goals in 1990.  Sala-i-Martin and Pinkovskiy say that by 2006 the African poverty rate was 30% lower than in 1995, and 28% lower than in 1990. They also reject the argument that this has been solely the result of wealthy elites pocketing the proceeds of bumper oil wealth.  While still high by developed country standards, they say the Gini coefficient, an international benchmark for social inequality, has declined consistently, if slowly, since the early 1990s.  Some development experts are not convinced. Stefan Dercon, of Oxford University, said the authors placed too much weight on government statistics such as GDP, and ignored other data. ""They believe the evidence that many of us would least trust and throw away the evidence we tend to think is fairly accurate. Painstakingly collected household consumption and income surveys, especially when over various years using the same method in each year, give a rather detailed picture of whether there is massive enrichment or not. And unfortunately, the evidence for Ethiopia, where I have been doing this for years, doesn't show such massive improvement.""  Following the most severe downturn in the global economy since the 1930s, there are also concerns that Africa's progress has been stalled. The World Bank warned in 2008 that the financial crisis would leave an extra 89 million people living on less than $1.25 a day by the end of this year.  However, Alison Evans, director of thinktank the Overseas Development Institute, said: ""Rather than starting from the premise that we never get any good news from Africa, we should all be embracing the principle that Africa is on a trajectory where poverty is fallingThis should reassure us that progress can be made, and we can build on that going forward.""  Countries in conflict have enjoyed a much less marked decline in poverty than their peaceful neighbours, the study finds, seeing only a small improvement during the first half of the 2000s.  Countries that were not at war saw their poverty rates decline from 40% in 1970 to about 25% by 2006.  Gerard Lyons, chief economist for Standard Chartered, said: ""I'm very positive about Africa. In the long term, I see an arc of growth from China through India and into Africa.""  Olver Buston, European director of One, the charity founded by Bono and Sir Bob Geldof, agreed that there were some reasons to be positive. ""I think what is true is that there has been progress on several fronts in Africa. During the Cold War, we poured a lot of money into Africa, propping up dictators, and the Soviets did the same thing. Afterwards, aid levels cynically collapsed, but the last decade or so has seen some important changes.""  He pointed out that 18 African countries without oil resources had clocked up solid economic growth of 5% or more on average over the past decade. ""We have a really negative mental image of Africa in the west, and we shouldn't have."" He added that Rwanda, Ethiopia and Zambia have cut the number of malaria deaths by two-thirds, and there are 43 million more children going to school in Africa than ten years ago.  However, with western governments due to gather in New York in September to assess progress against the Millennium Development Goals, he stressed that it was not time to abandon the continent. ""This shows that there's hope. Over the next five years, we need to consolidate these successes.""</SPAN></P>",0,"2012-05-25 05:11:31"

Of course some African countries like South Africa and Egypt are not quite as poor as others like Angola and Ethiopia. And though in recent years absolute poverty in Africa has shown some slight falls, African income levels have actually been dropping relative to the rest of the world. So poor Africa is getting relatively poorer on average, and 2011 sees drought in North East Africa again bringing the prospect of starvation to millions in the region affecting Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya - and in Somalia religious war has been worsening the famine situation there..   famine in africa  1. The land is a major problem in Africa, with many African countries having confused land ownership so that much useful land is unused - and in some African countries where rainfall is unreliable there is still little or no irrigation of land. Africa's natural resources have also been mostly monopolised by European and American companies largely taking money out of Africa. And African land degradation, largely due to poor land management, has mostly been worsening in recent years especially in East Africa and near the Sahara.  2. Financial aid going to African countries has often been mostly emergency food aid needed as short-term help with famines, and any longer-term aid has often been misappropriated for personal wealth by corrupt officials or for military spending. Where useful financial aid has been supplied to African countries it has often been in the form of loans with high interest rates that poor countries find too expensive a debt burden. Africa has to date attracted little foreign investment though much of that has been more stable longer-term European investment as in mining.  3. The terms of trade set by richer countries tend often to exploit poor countries and give unfairly low price for their exports of commodities such as tea, coffee, bananas and their other export products. And foreign businesses operating in Africa also often do not help the local economy as much as they easily could help. Some of these problems are of course not unique to Africa and are seen also in some non-African poor countries.  4. Education, medicine and drinking water are also major problems in poor African countries - as well as transport and energy. Diseases like AIDS, malaria and cholera are widespread with the latter two involving poor water systems. In some African countries a lack of adequate medical services is helping maintain poverty for many families.    5. Many have noted that countries in Africa have often suffered from civil wars and inadequate government, and this may be in part due to many African countries being artificial colonial creations with borders that make sustainable government more difficult. Conflict-torn countries with long running civil wars such as Angola, Burundi, Mozambique, Somalia and Uganda have had little effective government, making it very difficult to get hold of supplies or build necessary infrastructures. This has also given neighbouring countries big refugee problems. And much of Africa has also had corrupt government, like Zimbabwe. But in Africa both the wars and the corrupt governments maintaining poverty, have often been supported by richer Western governments.     But many countries in Africa are now showing some real signs of progress towards better governance. The African Union has established the voluntary self-monitoring Africa Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) for states to conform to agreed political, economic and corporate governance values. Twenty nine of Africa's fifty three states signed up to participate in APRM by June 2008, being - Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tome ",0,"2012-05-25 05:11:20"

It may not seem so common now in days, but it may be right in front of your face, without you taking in consideration the basic things. Now looking for a job, seems a little more difficult with certain obstacles, the stores don't tell you, such as being handsome, according to them, walking billboards seem to attract more customers than actual experience itself. They can randomly just go up to you and offer you a job, if you look handsome or attractive enough, i always knew our so society was messed up, but to this point it is really passing a limit. Not only are they hurting a person mentally but physically, they don't know what they are causing the person to do, when they walk out their store, for all they know, they can go to a deep depression, not only hurting themselfs but hurting their loved ones. Discriminating based on looks isn't exactly illegal but it should be. This isn't new it has kind of been around when it comes to strip clubs, and flight attendants and the waitress. It is affecting people, in the way that they need jobs and they aren't getting any, simply because of their appearance.</SPAN></P>",0,"2012-05-25 05:11:20"

Iâ€™ve become a royalist. There, Iâ€™ve said it.  I wonder how many Americans can say that?  I mean, after all, we rebelled against the idea of a king 235 years ago.  Thus, as a nation we donâ€™t even have a heritage of a royal family. Who do we make king or queen: a Kennedy, a Bush, Britney Spears?  I just think our experiment in democracy has failed in this new century. What I really should say is that our dabbling in republicanism is a disaster. As everyone knows, we are really a republic, not a democracy.  The unwashed rabble (let them eat cake!) putrifying Americaâ€™s major cities these days tell me what it would be like if we really were a democracy. I would move overseas if we became a pure democracy. (Oh, wait, I already have.)  What is my problem with the republic our Founding Fathers gave us? Nothing, in and of itself.  If I were the embodiment of the American people, I would look at the Constitution (after all, the progressives out there say it is â€œliving and breathingâ€) and say in the manner of George Constanza, â€œItâ€™s not you, itâ€™s me.â€  John Adams wrote,â€Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.â€  Twenty first century Americans are neither moral or religious.  The Constitution gives our people freedom on the basis that we can handle it in a responsible manner. We are as a government and as a people completely irresponsible.  This is where a king comes in. I think we are a little bit like the Israelites at the time of the Judges.  When they looked at the state of their society, they went to their leader Samuel and asked for a king.  Israel was a theocracy at the time. In theory, God was their ruler. A series of Judges, men like Samuel, Gideon and Samson, governed them.  However, the Scriptures say that that era was a time when everyone did what was right in their own eyes. The people were corrupt, and at least one of their judges (Samson) was, too, as well as Samuelâ€™s sons.  As a result, I think the law and order plank won the day in Israel and the movers and shakers decided that having a king or queen was in order. Samuel told them the implications of this.  The last judge in Israel told them that they would be under the kingâ€™s thumb. Their sons would have to fight in the army and their daughters would have to serve the kingdom.  The people would lose their property rights to â€œeminent domainâ€. The king would take the wazoo out of the Israelites, taking the best of everything.  The people did not relent. They still insisted on a king.  I think a monarchy would be just fine nowadays. It might return the United States to some measure of respectability.  The International Commission on Nobility and Royalty discusses some of the advantages of a monarchy on their website:  *Monarchies are magical and special;  * Monarchies provide the nation with a collective identity;  * Monarchies are grand and inspiring:  * Monarchies provide strength and stability:  * Monarchies provide a calm and dignified center;  * Monarchies offer traditions and continuity.  In my book, a royal government would be the best source of economic prosperity and national security. Why, a king or queen might actually get our borders under control.    The Commission notes:  Kings tend to be protective and build and strengthen the nation for a long and prosperous future for his loved ones and the people. In other words, he invests in the nation and its people.   For a good part of my life, America has been run by people of opposite ilk than this. These presidents and congresspersons have been corrupt, weakened our country and thrown the futures of our children down the toilet.  A cursory review of the Internet shows that a few individuals have actually had royal ideas in the last part of the 20th century, enough to even form a political party. These parties are documented by a website called â€œThe Mad Monarchistâ€.  However, they have bee abject failures due to lack of interest. The â€œMad Monarchistâ€ makes comments such as â€œdonâ€™t waste your timeâ€ and â€˜kingâ€™ is still a four letter word in the United States and that mindset is certainly not going to change anytime soonâ€.  I wonder who we could make king or queen? George Washington turned down the right to be our first monarch, but maybe we could use his bloodlines as a criterion for choosing our royal family.  According to â€œThe Daily Beastâ€, there is a man named Paul Washington in Texas who, based on rules of succession, could be a candidate for King of America. He is a descendant of George Washingtonâ€™s older brother. George himself was childless.  The Mad Monarch offers that in this day and age, if we chose to go the royal route, weâ€™d need to get ready for a â€œQueen Oprahâ€. I would agree, given the state of our pop culture.  He says there was a royalist group in the 1990s who thought that Princess Madeline of Sweden would be an appropriate choice. It was common during the day when monarchies were prevalent  for countries to invite foreign royalty to assume their thrones, and this lady apparently lived in the United States at the time.  Whomever we chose as our king or queen, weâ€™d have to do better than Prince Charles.  How about Larry the Cable Guy?  Iâ€™m serious. Why not a monarchy? It has to be a more honorable form of government than the current operation.  A monarch would carry with him or her a sense of noblesse oblige. Noble people would act nobly. This would be far better than the ignoble behavior which comes  from our leaders now.  </SPAN></P>",0,"2012-05-25 05:11:18"

A monarchy represents something that has been around for 1,000 years. A republic can never have that, as any head-of-state it has will be relatively new. A monarchy is also imminent, meaning it has weathered storms and endured through even the biggest crises. For example, the threat of that â€œlittle man with a strange mustacheâ€ (Hitler) is actually very small compared to the historical weight and constancy of the English monarchy.  2) The monarchy doesnâ€™t cost very much. Her Majesty the Queen is only the 50th richest person in the United Kingdom, and costs the taxpayer only 57p a year. The Prime Minister costs the taxpayer far more. Though the royal familyâ€™s wealth originally came from the fact that they owned and taxed all the land in England, now the â€œcivil listâ€ is voted on in Parliament every year. This list basically agrees that the nation will support the Queen, her husband Prince Philip, and (while she was alive) the Queen Mother. Prince Charles is supported by the proceeds of agricultural rents in the duchy of Cornwall (Wales), as per his position as the Prince of Wales. And, the monarchy actually brings in money because they are such a huge tourist attraction.  3) The Queen can never be corrupted, because she is too rich to be bribed or bullied. She has around 500 million pounds of personal wealth. So while a Prime Minister or elected official can be corrupt, at least the head-of-state canâ€™t be.  4) The monarchy is the basis of the Commonwealth. There are 83 countries currently in the British Commonwealth, and the Queen is the head of the Commonwealth. Every four years, all 83 countries send representatives to a meeting to have an intellectual exchange. The Queen, of course, is a very experienced politician, having been in power for about 60 years. It is very useful to have a forum for international discussion, and so the Commonwealth is a positive thing.  5) Monarchy is one of the only uniting factors in the United Kingdom. Few things actually unite Ireland, Scotland, England, and Wales, and the monarchy is one of them. Unity is a good thing.  One of the main objections to the monarchy is that it is the very pinnacle of a class system. If one is uncomfortable with the idea of a class system, especially a blatant class system with things such as titles and peerages, one is uncomfortable with the monarchy. Silly Americans, says Leslie Mitchell.  </SPAN></P>",0,"2012-05-25 05:11:17"

The only thing to do is to break them up into smaller units that are capable of supporting democratic rule. Yugoslavia was a prime example: out of one dictatorship, lots of smaller democracies. The reasons why democracy is better are legion: democracies don't fight one another; accountability and participation are good in themselves; they're more likely to be humane and, on the whole, they'll take better decisions - Churchill and Roosevelt made far fewer mistakes than Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin, and their casualty lists were far shorter. Anyway, since we all think democracy is best for ourselves, on what basis are we going to prefer lesser systems for others?   Democracy also forces both voters and leaders to be more mature, because they have to value the system more than any particular result. There's a story about an upper-class lady exclaiming in 1945, 'Good God, they've elected a Labour government. The country will never stand for it.' She came from a class that was used to having its own way, and just as spoilt children have to learn they can't always have their way, so did she. Nothing is better for people than that. You can see this more clearly in developing countries (I live in one - South Africa) than in developed ones.   Where democracy is a recent growth you get lots of uncontrollable egos, both at voter and leader level - parties and people that are simply not willing to accept electoral defeat or, often, can't even bear to see their side being criticised by a free press. These are so-called 'illiberal democracies', where majoritarian rule often swamps the normal democratic freedoms. They are inherently unstable since there are no real boundaries as to what the political elite might get up to, and usually the rule of law is the first casualty.   The sad fact is that there's no way for a country to become properly democratic except by living as a democracy over time, with all the ups and downs that means. France got its first democratic regime in 1789, but its first stable democracy was achieved only in 1871, and even that was extremely uncertain for a generation. Even in the West, democracy is quite recent - women only got the vote in 1945 in Italy and France, and in Switzerland not until 1971.   </SPAN></P>",0,"2012-05-25 05:11:17"

It is like an electronic drug â€“ a â€œpharmatronicâ€ according to Wired. Studies have shown that playing tetris increases the consumption rate of glucose in the brain giving a slight high. However after 4 to 8 weeks of playing tetris daily, the brain seems to get more efficient and the consumption rate of glucose drops down to normal levels while the score increases seven-fold on an average. Pokhilko, the psychologist who seemed to need treatment himself had this to say about the game. </span></p><p style=""font-size:12;font-family:Portable User Interface;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-align:Left;""><span>   Tetris was unlike any other videogame, mostly because it was (and still is) played by as many women as men, as many adults as children.

Americans are getting fatter and fatter every year. It is estimated that as many as one in five Americans is obese, a condition defined as being more than 30 percent above the ideal weight based on height. Even more alarming is that fact that obesity rates for children have doubled over the past 20 years, and overweight children are being diagnosed with obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes, sleep apnea and respiratory illnesses that in the past have only afflicted adults.   As the health care costs of treating obesity-related illnesses mount, some are looking to place the blame for increasing obesity rates on the purveyors of fast food. Facing fierce competition for customer loyalty, fast food chains such as McDonalds, Burger King and Wendy's have promoted their over-sized burgers, extra-large servings for fries, and buckets of soda, all at low prices. Busy and cash-strapped families increasingly rely on take-out food for family dinners, and regular consumption of over-sized portions of fatty foods can leads to widespread obesity.  </span></p><p style=""font-size:12;font-family:Portable User Interface;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-align:Left;""><span>The portions served by fast food chains and other restaurants are far larger than the recommended portion size for most foods. Food costs for restaurants are relatively low, compared to the costs of rent and labor, so it makes sense for them to offer larger portions that make their customers feel like they are getting a bang for the buck.   As American eat out more and more frequently, they become accustomed to those oversized portion, and think that such portions are normal. The high caloric content of these large servings leads to weight gain for regular fast food customers, and obesity can lead to many dangerous health problems.   Fast food chains do not alert their customers to the hazardously high calorie and fat content of the food they offer. They deserve some of the blame for the epidemic of obesity, and lawsuits brought by victims of their toxic food would force these companies to take some responsibility for their dangerous products.   </span></p></div>",0,"2013-04-07 21:33:57"

The plan was for macbeth to go kill Duncan and put the bloody dagger near the servants so it can look like they were the ones who killed him. but macbeth didnt stick with the plan, he only killed duncan and came home with the bloody dagger in his hand, so lady macbeth had to take it from him and go plant it on the Duncans servants.</SPAN></P>",0,"2012-05-25 05:11:09"
