It is heavily inspired by Infiniminer . \n From its creation, Minecraft was developed almost exclusively by Notch until Jens "Jeb" Bergensten started working with him, and has since become head of its development. It features music by Daniel "C418" Rosenfeld and paintings by Kristoffer Zetterstrand . Initially released as what is now known as Minecraft Classic on May 17, 2009, the game was released as Minecraft 1.0 on November 18, 2011. Since its release, Minecraft has expanded to mobile devices and a version for Xbox 360 . \n Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with, and modify a dynamically-generated map made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks . In addition to blocks, the environment features plants , mobs , and items . Some activities in the game include mining for ore , fighting hostile mobs , and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game\'s open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their own single player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks , and a mysterious underworld called the Nether . Ultimately, the completely optional goal of the game is to travel to an alternate dimension called the End , and defeat the Ender Dragon . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Purchase and availability \n \n 1.1 Hardware requirements \n \n \n 2 Gameplay \n \n 2.1 Player \n 2.2 Blocks \n 2.3 Mining \n 2.4 Crafting and smelting \n 2.5 Brewing and enchanting \n 2.6 Mobs \n 2.7 The Nether \n 2.8 The End \n 2.9 Multiplayer \n \n \n 3 Development \n \n 3.1 Creation \n 3.2 Classic \n 3.3 Survival Test \n 3.4 Indev \n 3.5 Infdev \n 3.6 Alpha \n 3.7 Beta \n 3.8 Minecraft 1.0 \n 3.9 Table of features \n 3.10 Pocket Edition \n 3.11 Xbox 360 Edition \n 3.12 Lego Minecraft \n \n \n 4 Modifications and third-party programs \n \n 4.1 Mod API \n 4.2 Texture packs \n 4.3 Unofficial mods \n 4.4 Third-party programs \n \n \n 5 Platforms \n \n 5.1 Computer \n 5.2 Pocket Edition \n 5.3 Xbox 360 Edition \n 5.4 Pi Edition \n \n \n 6 Reception \n \n 6.1 Awards \n \n \n 7 References in popular culture \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n Purchase and availability \n \n \n \n  \n Main menu of Minecraft with random splash text.

All editions of the game can be bought as a one-time purchase. [8] Once purchased, the game can be played in a web browser or a downloadable client (the Minecraft launcher ). It is also possible to buy Minecraft gift codes for others, for the same price as buying the game for oneself. Minecraft Classic is available to anyone to play for free on Minecraft.net , but must be played in-browser. [9] \n Previous versions of Minecraft ( Indev , Infdev , Alpha , and Beta ) were once available on the site for paid users, while Survival Test , a version of Classic, was free to all. All older versions of Minecraft , besides Classic, are no longer available. \n Pocket Edition can be purchased at the Android Market and iTunes App Store for Android and iOS respectively. \n Hardware requirements \n \n See also: Hardware performance \n \n \n Requirements recommended by Mojang .

When the user starts a game, the player is put in a world, generated by a random or specified seed , with an empty inventory . The player has a health bar with 10 hearts, and can be damaged by falls, suffocation, drowning, fire , lava , lightning , cacti , falling into the Void , and being hit by hostile mobs . Damage to health can be mitigated by armor , and health can be restored by eating food , or if difficulty is set to Peaceful, health will regenerate on its own. Hunger is also a factor if the game is not in Peaceful Mode, depleting over time and even faster while sprinting . Food will replenish health; however, eating rotten flesh and raw chicken has a chance of poisoning the player. Depending on the difficulty level, a low hunger level will deplete a players health. \n A player\'s skin can be changed on the profile page of Minecraft.net. \n Blocks \n \n Main article: Blocks \n \n Blocks are the objects that make up Minecraft, and were borrowed from Minecraft \'s original influence, Infiniminer . There are different types of blocks; natural blocks such as grass , stone , and various ores are randomly generated to the world. There are also blocks that players can craft , such as a crafting table and a furnace . Resources can be extracted from blocks by hand or by using tools . Some of these resources are simply blocks in the player\'s inventory that can be placed elsewhere, while others are used as material to create other blocks or tools. Others yield no practical use whatsoever. Bedrock and End Portal Frames are the only unbreakable blocks. \n Mining \n \n Main article: Mining \n \n \n \n \n  \nVarious Ores (in proximity of lava ) that can be mined \n \n \n As the game\'s name would suggest, mining is one of the main aspects of Minecraft . Mining is done to extract ore and other materials from below the surface of the map. These ores include coal , iron , gold , redstone , diamond , lapis lazuli , and emerald . These are crucial in making several useful items. Mining can involve digging a hole from the surface or going down through a cave . In Beta 1.8, Abandoned Mine Shafts were added, creating extra areas to look for resources. \n Crafting and smelting \n \n Main articles: Crafting and Smelting \n \n \n \n \n  \nA Crafting Table \n \n \n Crafting allows players to create new tools and blocks using items from their inventory . Crafting was first implemented in Indev , and Notch has expanded the crafting recipes with new versions, blocks, and items. To craft, a player can use the 2\xc3\x972 grid in the inventory or the 3\xc3\x973 grid provided by a crafting table . Smelting requires a furnace in addition to fuel, and processes blocks such as iron ore into a more useful form (e.g. iron ingot ). \n Brewing and enchanting \n \n Main articles: Brewing and Enchanting \n \n \n \n \n  \nAn Enchantment Table with glyphs being absorbed into it \n \n \n Brewing and enchanting were game elements added in Minecraft 1.0 . Brewing creates potions from various ingredients and water using a Brewing Stand . They are stored in a glass bottle and then consumed by the player or thrown at other mobs to generate a certain effect based on the ingredients used to create the potion. Enchanting is also used to upgrade armor, tools, or weapons with a enchanting table . More powerful enchantments can be accessed by gaining experience and placing bookshelves around the enchanting table. \n Mobs \n \n Main article: Mobs \n \n \n \n \n  \nA creeper in daylight \n \n \n Mobs (Short for Mobiles) are the animals and other creatures that inhabit the map. These include zombies that attack by melee; skeletons that have a bow and arrow , spiders that jump large distances and can climb walls, and creepers that explode when near the player. Rare mobs include Spider Jockeys , skeletons riding spider; Endermen , that are tall, black creatures with purple eyes and turn aggressive when the player looks at them, and slimes , which spawn deep within the map. The Nether features ghasts ; flying mobs that spit exploding fire balls and attack without provocation, and Zombie Pigmen ; modified Pigmen with a Golden Sword and are neutral. In 1.0.0, blazes were added in the Nether (which shoot fireballs and fly) and Magma Cubes , which are similar to slimes but jump a bit higher). In The End , Ender Dragons exist; they are the first boss in Minecraft , but, as of snapshot 12w34a, the Wither was added as both a utility mob and a boss mob. \n To aid the player there are several passive mobs: pigs , cows , chickens , sheep , and squid , and two tameable mob types, wolves and ocelots . Wolves will attack enemy mobs if the player engages them. Cats, or tamed ocelots will keep creepers at bay and can\'t take fall damage. Passive mobs other than wolves yield resources when killed, such as beef , porkchops , chicken , wool , leather , and ink sacs . If killed when on fire, the meat drops are changed to steaks , cooked porkchops and cooked chickens . \n There is currently only one NPC mob: villagers , which spawn and move about within their NPC Village . \n The Nether \n \n Main article: The Nether \n \n The Nether is a dimension in Minecraft , accessible from the Overworld by a Nether Portal . It was added in the Halloween Update on October 30, 2010. It was described by Notch as "a brand new hell world". It consists mainly of Netherrack and generates lakes of lava. It is populated by Zombie Pigmen , Blazes , and Ghasts . \n \n \n \n  \n The Nether \n \n \n The End \n \n Main article: The End \n \n The End is another dimension of the game where the player battles the Ender Dragon . The End is accessible by entering a End Portal in a Stronghold . The End is composed of End Stone and is inhabited by Endermen . \n \n \n \n  \nThe End \n \n \n Multiplayer \n \n Main articles: Server and Multiplayer \n \n \n \n \n  \nPvP on a multiplayer server \n \n \n The multiplayer feature was introduced on June 8, 2009 for Classic , and later as SMP (Survival Multiplayer) on August 4, 2010, and has been a popular part of the game ever since. Minecraft multiplayer servers have developed to include their own rules and customs, guided by their administrators and moderators. The term griefer , meaning a player who causes grief, is a typical term on the internet, but has taken up its own definition on Minecraft servers: a person who destroys or defiles other users\' creations on servers. \n Griefers are the reason many server administrators make rules, but this has been taken a step further with modifications to the Mojang server and even plugin-based replacement servers such as Bukkit . Because of these plugin-based servers, new user-created features have shown up in Minecraft . This includes features like money, vehicles, protection, RPG elements and more. These features normally do not require modification to a user\'s client and can be accessed by using chat commands. With the default controls, the chat screen is brought up by pressing T . After 1.2.4, it was now possible to scroll back through previous chat entries using the arrow keys. \n One popular game on multiplayer servers is Spleef (a play on the word "grief"), a game where the player\'s aim is to make another player drop through the floor by destroying blocks beneath the opponent\'s feet. This is typically played in a designated area. \n Development \n \n See also: Version history \n \n Creation \n \n \n \n  \n Cave game \n \n \n Notch got the idea for Minecraft after playing Infiniminer with other members of the TIG Source forums in 2009. [11] Other influences include Dwarf Fortress , Dungeon Keeper , [12] and Notch\'s own previous project, RubyDung . [13] \n \n \n  \n \xe2\x80\x9c \n I realized that a game that simple yet that dynamic had a lot of potential to turn into a really great game, and kept coming up with things I wanted to change and stuff I wanted to add. \n \xe2\x80\x9e \n \n \n \n ~ Notch&#160;on minecraft.net [14]  \n \n \n \n When he first started working on Minecraft , Notch had planned for it to just be a small project. For instance, when Notch uploaded the first YouTube video of Minecraft on May 13, 2009, he had not yet decided on a name, and simply referred to it as a "cave game". [15] [16] The name " Minecraft: Order of the Stone " (a reference to Order of the Stick , a web comic and "one of the best things on the internet") [17] was announced the next day, [18] and then shortly after, it was shortened to " Minecraft " as it was much simpler and to prevent people from confusing it with Order of the Stick . The game was finally released for an "early private singleplayer alpha" on May 16, 2009. [19] \n Classic \n \n Main article: Classic \n \n \n \n \n  \n Minecraft Classic \n \n \n Minecraft 0.0.11a was publicly released the day after the private release on May 17, 2009, [20] and the game received mention on IndieGames.com the day after that. [21] This phase was later named Minecraft Classic . [22] In July, Minecraft was rewritten to use the Lightweight Java Gaming Library (LWJGL) . [23] Until Minecraft Beta reintroduced it, Classic was the only version of Minecraft with the Creative game mode, which allows the player to build and destroy blocks, allowing the creation of all sorts of objects. Players are given an infinite amount of each block to build with. Players can still play Classic for free on the official Minecraft website here in Singleplayer and also in Multiplayer here , and Notch has stated it will remain for historical purposes. \n Survival Test \n \n Main article: Survival Test \n \n Survival Test was released as a version of Classic on September 1, 2009. It was the introduction of Survival Mode. In it, the player now had to mine blocks, face mobs , and had a health bar. If the player were to die, the map was lost, and unless backed up, the user would have to start over with a new map. \n Indev \n \n Main article: Indev \n \n \n \n \n  \n Indev \n \n \n Indev (short for "in development") was released on December 23, 2009 after Notch received requests to let the community try out new features he was implementing in Survival Test. Indev version 0.31 was released to the public on minecraft.net/indev and available only to people who had purchased the game. When a new game was started, the player would spawn in a prefabricated wooden house. \n Updates introduced a more complex and realistic lighting scheme than Classic . Indev received more updates after this, adding a few fundamental features to Minecraft as it went. During its lifespan, some updates were devoted mostly to testing new things, like torches or fire. Unique to Indev was level types, similar to biomes and the Dimensions - for example, Floating Islands and the Sky Dimension , and Hell and The Nether . Like Survival Test, if the player were to die, all progress was lost. \n Infdev \n \n Main article: Infdev \n \n \n Infdev (standing for Inf inite Dev elopment) was released on February 27, 2010, and became the third phase of Minecraft\'s development. It featured the important addition of maps that can generate infinitely, which extended the gameplay possibilities even further as well as other upgrades including new crafting recipes , 3D clouds , a new terrain generator, a more realistic fluid system, and more complex caves. However, Infdev scrapped other features of Indev such as world themes . This in turn spelled the demise of features such as \'floating islands\' and \'permaday\'. These removals are understandable, as Infdev\'s main purpose was to develop infinite maps. However, some extra gameplay features and items were added, such as the addition of minecarts and the ability to respawn. After being replaced by Alpha on June 28, 2010, Infdev remained available on the official Minecraft website until September 2010, when it was removed, making it impossible to play except with downgraders or a .jar. \n Alpha \n \n Main article: Alpha \n \n \n \n \n  \n The Nether \n \n \n Alpha was released on June 28, 2010, and saw many major features added to Minecraft . Multiplayer for Survival was created, and features such as Redstone Circuits , boats , new music , new mobs, and a Difficulty setting were added to the game, often without announcement in " Seecret Friday Updates ". \n The Halloween Update on October 31, 2010 was a major update adding biomes , The Nether , new mobs, blocks and items, and other changes. \n One could see Alpha\'s introduction of biomes as being the return, at least in part, of Indev\'s world themes , and indeed the Nether is not unlike the \'Hell\' world theme. Another reintroduction in Alpha was the return of multiplayer . Unlike Classic\'s Creative multiplayer, Alpha\'s multiplayer was only available in Survival form (logically called Survival multiplayer .) \n Beta \n \n Main article: Beta \n \n Beta was the fifth and last phase of Minecraft\'s development before its official release. Beta was released on December 20, 2010. Features that were added include a new logo and launcher, achievements and statistics , weather , Smooth Lighting , dyes , more plant types (two new types of trees and Tall Grass ), wolves and squid , beds , and other blocks and items. \n The Adventure Update was a major set of updates, focusing on exploring, combat, and add an ending to the game. Features added include new terrain generator, new mobs, blocks, biomes, and items. More generated structures where added; NPC villages , strongholds , abandoned mine shafts . Changes to general gameplay include an improved combat system including critical hits and experience , a reintroduced Creative Mode , Hardcore Mode , and a way to finish the game by traveling to The End and defeating the Ender Dragon . \n Originally planned to be started in Beta 1.7, the first part of the Adventure Update was released as Beta 1.8 on September 14, 2011. Starting on September 9th, 2011, developmental versions were "leaked" by Mojang. [24] Beta 1.9 was never released, but 6 pre-releases using the 1.9 version number were made available for users to test and report bugs back to Mojang. On October 18, a feature freeze went into effect and Mojang shifted all Minecraft development focus to fixing bugs and preparing the game for release. [25] On November 13 a release candidate of 1.0 was released, along with an official update to 1.8.1 that added sounds from the developmental version. [26] \n Minecraft 1.0 \n \n \n \n  \nThe Ender Dragon in The End \n \n \n \n Main article: Minecraft 1.0 \n \n The official release of Minecraft , Minecraft 1.0 , was released on November 18, 2011, during MineCon . The release includes many features from the Adventure Update that were not included in Beta 1.8. The most prominent feature is an ending to the game, which can be achieved by defeating the Ender Dragon boss in The End . For the full version changelog of Minecraft 1.0 , see Version History . \n 1.2.1 released on March 1, 2012, added the Jungle biome as well as mob and chat improvements. 1.3.1, released on August 1, made many changes to gameplay, added Adventure mode , many multiplayer enhancements and other improvements. The Pretty Scary Update , version 1.4.2, was released on October 25, included new mobs, including the new Wither boss mob, blocks, and items. \n Table of features \n Below is a short summary of what features each new milestone introduces. \n \n \n Feature \n Classic \n Indev \n Infdev \n Alpha \n Beta \n Minecraft 1.0 \n \n \n Creative \n Survival Test \n \n \n Premium account \n Not required \n Not required \n Required \n Required \n Required \n Required \n Required for full version and multiplayer \n \n \n Availability \n Yes \n Downgraders or .jars \n Downgraders or .jars \n Downgraders or .jars \n Downgraders or .jars \n Downgraders or .jars \n Yes \n \n \n Multiplayer \n Yes \n No \n No \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Crafting \n No \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Inventory \n Yes \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Health \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Day/night cycle \n No \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Infinite map size \n No \n No \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Map environment \n No \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Caves \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Biomes \n No \n No \n No \n No \n After 1.2.0 \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Set spawn location \n Yes \n No \n No \n No \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Permadeath \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n No \n No \n Hardcore \n Hardcore \n \n \n Mobs \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Infinite water \n Yes \n Yes \n Only in Island maps \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Redstone Wiring \n No \n No \n No \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Achievements and Statistics \n No \n No \n No \n No \n No \n After 1.5 \n Yes \n \n \n The Nether \n No \n No \n No \n No \n After 1.2.0 \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n The End \n No \n No \n No \n No \n No \n 1.9 Pre-release 3 \n Yes \n \n \n Coloured wool/cloth \n Yes \n Partial \n Partial \n No \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Animal Breeding \n No \n No \n No \n No \n No \n 1.9 Pre-release \n Yes \n \n \n Potions \n No \n No \n No \n No \n No \n 1.9 Pre-release \n Yes \n \n \n Enchanting \n No \n No \n No \n No \n No \n 1.9 Pre-release \n Yes \n \n \n Pocket Edition \n \n Main article: Pocket Edition \n \n Minecraft Pocket Edition was released on August 16, 2011 and is designed for mobile platforms, with gameplay similar to Classic. It debuted on Sony\'s Xperia Play Android phone. The game is being developed by Mojang employees Jens Bergensten , Aron Nieminen , Johan Bernhardsson and Daniel Kaplan . A version for all supported Android phones was released on October 7, 2011 after the exclusivity agreement between Sony and Mojang expired and the touch screen controls were added. [27] [28] On November 16, a version for iOS was released. \n Xbox 360 Edition \n \n Main article: Xbox 360 Edition \n \n Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition was released on May 9, 2012. It was announced by Mojang on June 7, 2011 at E3 and the release date was announced on March 22 nd through PlayXBLA\'s Twitter account. Kinect support will be available later on. \n Lego Minecraft \n \n Main article: Lego Minecraft \n \n In December 2011, Mojang submitted the concept of Minecraft merchandise to Lego for the Lego Cuusoo program, from which it quickly received 10,000 votes by users, prompting Lego to review the concept. [29] On January 24, 2012, Lego Cuusoo announced the concept was approved and they would develop sets based around Minecraft . In February 2012, the first Lego Minecraft set of Micro World was showcased and made available for pre-orders, with a release set for the summer of 2012. [30] \n Modifications and third-party programs \n Mod API \n \n Main article: Mods#Official Modding API \n \n Notch has always planned to add a mod API, and announced official plans to support one in the game on April 26, 2011. Although the code for the API exists in the game and the button on main menu to access texture packs is labeled "Mods and Texture Packs", as of yet it has not been implemented. (In 1.0, this button was renamed "Texture Packs") [31] In a post before the release of Minecraft 1.0 , Notch said that the mod API would be coming along with a new launcher. [32] \n When Jeb became head of Minecraft\'s development in December 2011, he stated that the mod API would be his top priority, as "there is no way in hell I will be able to add as much content as the whole internet can do". He said that they were talking to existing mod developers such as Bukkit , Minecraft Forge, and Minecraft Coder Pack . [33] \n Texture packs \n \n Main article: Texture Packs \n \n The game officially supports changing most of its various textures through Texture Packs. These have to contain a certain structure of files and folders, contained in a .zip archive file and placed in the texturepack folder of the .minecraft folder. The texture packs, as well as the folder can be accessed at the main menu. The extent to which the textures are changed is dependent on how many files are contained in the texture pack. \n In Minecraft 1.6, the Mojang team replaced texture packs with resource packs . \n Unofficial mods \n \n Main article: Mods \n \n Minecraft can be modified by replacing or adding Java class files to minecraft.jar . This method of making modifications are not supported by Mojang as they can break the game if the mod is outdated, defective, or is conflicting with another mod. Some of these user created modifications have been found to impress Notch and the original authors have been attributed under Additional Programming; an implementation of Paul Spooner \'s Forestry editor script (not actually an internal mod) and Hippoplatimus\' Piston Mod was added in Infdev (April 13, 2010) and Beta 1.7 , respectively, although the Forester script was later removed in Infdev . [34] [35] [36] [37] \n Third-party programs \n \n Main article: Programs and editors \n \n There as many programs designed for Minecraft .

It was initially launched exclusively for the Xperia PLAY on Google Play (formerly known as Android Market) [4] for $6.99/\xc2\xa34.28/5,49\xe2\x82\xac on August 16, 2011, along with a free demo version. It was later released for other Android devices on the 7th of October 2011. [5] Minecraft Pocket Edition for iOS devices was released on Thursday, the 17th of November 2011 [6] on the iOS App Store, one day before the launch of Minecraft 1.0 at MineCon 2011 and currently costs $6.99 US and \xe2\x82\xac5.49 EU. On September 13, 2012, the Pocket Edition was made available for purchase on the Amazon Appstore. There is also a demo avalible, but it does not save when you power down your device. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Gameplay \n 2 Development \n \n 2.1 Release \n 2.2 Alpha \n \n \n 3 Controls \n \n 3.1 Android &amp; iOS \n \n 3.1.1 Xperia PLAY \n \n \n 3.2 Tablet features \n \n \n 4 System requirements \n 5 Helpful Hints &amp; Tips \n 6 Trivia \n 7 Gallery \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Gameplay \n \n \n \n  \nIn-game screenshot. \n \n \n The objective of the game remains the same as its original PC and Xbox Edition counterparts, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. However, Pocket Edition lacks some of the Survival elements present in other versions of the game, such as redstone and minecart rail systems. The multiplayer mode is cross-platform compatible between Android and iOS, but not Demo/Lite with full version. [7] Mojang has announced that online multiplayer through the Pocket Realms feature will be added in the 0.7.2 and 0.8.0 updates where players can buy servers through in-app purchases. \n Pocket Edition is most commonly known as the least developed version of Minecraft. Even in it\'s 7th version, it is well behind in features compared to PC Edition and Xbox 360 Edition \n The HUD and other elements is adapted to mobile standards of gameplay. Interactions are made via touchscreen and, on Android operating systems, soft keys (both the iOS and Android versions of Pocket Edition have the same gameplay, though [8] ). To comply with the disadvantages of touchscreen gameplay, several features were revised. For instance, the crafting system uses the MATTIS system and disposal of items are made by long-tapping their icon on the hotbar. The graphics, which is akin to that of Minecraft Alpha , was downgraded. Other examples include: \n \n Worlds are finite (256 by 256 blocks) as in Classic version, but there isn\'t infinite water at world corners. \n The terrain generation is similar to that of Alpha \'s. It lacks many biomes and generated structures . \n In-game items differ from the items that were present in Alpha , the notable differences being the addition of Quartz and Nether blocks, as well as beds . \n As the world is not infinite (not unlimited world area), an interesting new game mechanic called "animal spawn control" can be used. This includes removing or covering all dirt blocks on the surface of the world (and therefore the grass blocks) except in a small area to control where animals spawn. It will also increase their spawn rate. \n Clouds are in Pocket Edition as of 0.6.0. They are 2D like the clouds on PC in "Fast" graphics setting. \n As of 0.6.0 the sky in Pocket Edition only has clouds and is a lush blue color. The sun , moon , and stars will be added in later updates. \n It lacks many of the settings the Classic version has. \n Pocket Edition has physics for sand , gravel , and primed TNT . Water and lava are also affected by gravity whether placed with buckets or existing from spawn. \n Online (LAN) mode only allows 5 players to be on a single server. Internet support is featured as Minecraft Realms (as of version 0.7.2). \n Crafting uses the MATTIS system. \n The Nether is not present, but it is replaced by the Nether Reactor . The Reactor is planned to eventually be replaced. \n Roses are not present, but are replaced by Cyan Flowers , alias Blue Roses. [9] However, in the hot bar, it is named "Rose". Also, red dye is obtained by burning red mushrooms in a furnace. \n \n \n \n \n  \nBlocks exclusive to Pocket Edition : Stone Cutter \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nExclusive block: Nether Reactor Core \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nExclusive block: Glowing Obsidian \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nExclusive block: Cyan Flower \n \n \n \n All of the included blocks (as of version 0.7.2) are as follows:\n \n Cobblestone \n Moss Stone \n Stone Brick (three types, excluding chiseled) \n Stone \n Brick \n Wooden Plank \n Dirt \n Grass Block \n Clay \n Sandstone \n Sand \n Gravel (old texture) \n Wood (three types, only excluding jungle) \n Cobblestone Stairs \n Wooden Stairs \n Brick Stairs \n Stone Brick Stairs \n Sandstone Stairs \n Stone Slab \n Block of Diamond \n Lapis Lazuli Block \n Obsidian \n \n Glowing Obsidian \n \n \n Snow (Block) \n Glass \n \n Block \n Pane \n \n \n Glowstone \n Nether Reactor Core \n Wool (all colors) \n Ladder \n Torch \n Wooden Door \n Trapdoor \n Fence \n \n Post \n Gate \n \n \n Bed \n Bookshelf \n Painting \n Crafting Table \n Chest \n Furnace \n TNT \n Flower\n \n Yellow Flower \n Cyan Flower \n \n \n Mushroom \n \n Red \n Brown \n \n \n Cacti \n Melon \n Sugar Cane \n Three types of Sapling , excluding jungle \n Three types of Leaves , excluding jungle \n Seeds \n Melon Seeds \n Bonemeal \n Every type of Tool \n All types of Quartz \n Stonecutter \n Netherrack \n Nether Brick \n Sign \n Spawn Egg \n \n Sheep \n Pigs \n Cows \n Chicken \n \n \n Bucket \n \n Empty \n Water \n Lava \n Milk \n \n \n Egg \n Cake \n Water \n Lava \n Fire \n \n \n All of the included mobs (as of version 0.7.2) are as follows:\n \n Sheep \n Chicken \n Cow \n Pig \n Zombie \n Creeper \n Skeleton \n Zombie Pigman \n Spider \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Development \n [ edit ] Release \n \n Main article: Pocket Edition version history \n \n A video of an early prototype was released on Twitter, showing the game on the Xperia PLAY. The alpha version was recently released, and became no longer exclusive to the Xperia PLAY on the 7th of October 2011. The non-exclusive version was going to be released on September 29 th for Android [10] but there were several severe bugs that needed to be fixed; the release was delayed until the 7th of October. \n A version for iOS devices was confirmed to be released before 2012 in an interview with Mojang [11] and was subsequently released on the 17th of November 2011. \n [ edit ] Alpha \n \n \n \n  \nLogo used until 0.7.0\'s slight change logo \n \n \n After the initial releases for iOS and Android, updates were released in parallel, with the same features being added for both platforms. During the Alpha stage, various aspects of gameplay were introduced into Pocket Edition including: crafting, smelting, more blocks, items, mobs and more gamemodes to bring it closer to the PC version. In the newest update, players are given the option of diamond, iron, gold, and leather armor. There is also new features never seen before in the computer version such as the stone cutter (a crafting table specifically for stone blocks). They also have fancy clouds which makes the "Fancy Graphics" more important to the players. \n MCPE Beta has been discussed among the development team, and based off of information in Johan Bernhardsson\'s twitch.tv livestream of 0.6.2, he plans to add in-game music, Endermen, caves, and possibly infinite worlds. He has mentioned but does not know if he can implement enchanting, redstone, the End, lava springs, and sprinting. \n [ edit ] Controls \n \n Main article: Controls#Pocket Edition \n \n [ edit ] Android &amp; iOS \n The Android and iOS versions feature a D-pad at the bottom-left corner of the screen, which controls movement. The jump button is located in the center of the d-pad. As of 0.6.0 the d-pad is more blocky, and when moving forward, two strafing buttons will appear. Note that when moving towards an adjacent block that is one level higher than the Player , the player will automatically jump up the block. One can place blocks by tapping the screen in a desired location. Destroying blocks is similar to the PC version\'s way, but rather than clicking the mouse, the player taps and holds. The search button used to be able to change the camera to and from third person view , but now this has to be done via the pause screen, and the menu and back buttons will open the pause screen. To open the inventory screen, tap the triple dotted button on the right of the hot bar. You can touch and hold in item in the hot bar to throw it, and if the hot bar contains a stack of items, it will throw the entire stack. You cannot divide it unless interfacing with a container (chest, furnace). \n [ edit ] Xperia PLAY \n *Controlled with slide out PlayStation keyboard: \n  - Open inventory \n  - Scroll right in hotbar \n  - Jump (press twice to toggle flying mode in Creative*) \n  - Scroll left in hotbar \n D-Pad: Move \n Left Touchpad: Sneak \n Right Touchpad: Look/Turn \n Select: Bring up crafting menu ( Survival only) \n L1: Break Blocks \n R1: Place Blocks \n Menu: Pause \n \n * To fly: Press jump twice in a row. To fly higher, hold the jump button and press up on the directional pad. To fly downward, hold jump and press down. ( Creative Only) \n \n [ edit ] Tablet features \n All devices have an option to enable Split Touch Controls, which may be more suitable for bigger screens. There is a cross hair and the right half of the screen lets the player rotate the camera. \n Other than the screen size difference allowing 6 slots in the hotbar (which as of 0.7.0 if the D-pad on other devices is small, you get an extra slot), the tablet version of the game is the same as other versions, hence the ability to play multiplayer cross-platform with other devices. \n [ edit ] System requirements \n \n Main article: Pocket Edition hardware performance (Android) \n Main article: Pocket Edition hardware performance (iOS) \n \n \n \n \n Android \n iOS \n \n \n Version \n Android 2.3 "Gingerbread" \n iOS 4.3.3 \n \n \n Processor \n Any with support of floating-point calculations ("ARM-v7a code") \n 600&#160;MHz ARMv7 Cortex CPU \n800&#160;MHz Apple A4 CPU \n \n \n Storage \n Varies \n 4.3 MB (100 MB to 1 GB is encouraged for world saving) \n \n \n Data Connection \n Optional ( Realms access) \n Optional (Realms access) \n \n \n Supported Devices \n \n Sony Ericsson Xperia Play [12] \nSony Ericsson Xperia Ray [13] [14] \nSony Ericsson Xperia Mini Pro [14] \n more \n \n iPod Touch (3rd, 4th, and 5th Generation) \niPhone (3GS, 4, 4S, and 5) \niPad (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Generation) \niPad Mini \n more \n \n \n Some devices below these specifications have been known to work fine either with or without custom ROM images, kernels, and overclocking of the CPU. However, the CPU " MSM7227 " is not supported due to its lack of the floating-point unit. [15] \n [ edit ] Helpful Hints &amp; Tips \n \n Make sure your battery is charged, and/or plugged in (3D gaming drains the battery quickly). \n Get used to the controls before playing on servers (it is easy to mine the block under a torch by mistake). \n Tap and hold an item in the hotbar to drop it. \n Know the difference between Hostile and non-hostile mobs. If you are entirely new to Minecraft, a simple trick can be used to differentiate: Hostiles will approach and follow you, passives will ignore you. \n Know how to apply armor and manage your health. Armor is next to the Crafting tab in the inventory screen. \n Peer-to-peer networking requires UDP port 19132 \n If you\'re having trouble with block placement/mining accuracy - turn on split touch controls. This brings up the crosshair from the PC and Xbox versions to allow more precise placement. \n If you are feeling overwhelmed by hostile mobs, turn on Peaceful mode in the options menu. \n If you want to play online download "Multiplayer for Minecraft PE" (iOS Only) (Not required after 0.7.0 update) \n If you are looking for diamonds, they spawn deep underground, near bedrock. \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n \n \n  \nExample of blocks "snapping" to the indev wall \n \n \n \n Players can have skins on the iOS version and Android and the lite version by replacing char.png in the app file. However, the chosen skin will appear as another player\'s skin if playing over local Wi-Fi. [16] \n In the demo video, before the game was released, smooth lighting was available. It was taken out due to bugs being produced on a wide range of devices. The code is still present in the game and can be made available by modifying the game. As of 0.7.0, it is on by default and can be toggled in Options under the "Experimental" section, meaning that it is still under testing. \n Worlds played before 0.3.0 update had the other wool and sugar cane (block). \n The terrain.png file in the APK file found on Android devices is nearly identical to that in the PC version, containing textures for items unimplemented in the Pocket Edition (e.g., cauldron , End Portal ). \n It is possible to play multiplayer over Bluetooth even though it is not coded into the game. Tutorial here. (not available since iOS 6) \n The Indev wall is also cut by the height limit allowing players to go over it. \n By placing ladders on the TOP of blocks at the edge of a map (stacking ladders on the top of ladders also works) it is possible to place ladders on the Indev wall as if it were a solid block. \n Blocks that "snap to" other blocks such as torches, glass panes, and fences will "snap to" the indev wall as if it were an existing block. Torches only do this if an attempt is made to place them on a block they can\'t be placed on such as ladders. \n The rose is textured to a cyan color. Even though its considered a rose, it cannot be crafted into dye; rose red dye is obtained by smelting red mushrooms instead. \n If you have any kind of modifier or command to give yourself any item in the Minecraft entity folder (e.g. iron door) the background of the non-existing entity will appear red meaning it does not exist or was never meant to. \n The average placing/destroying block range is 4-6 on the PC version but for the iOS/Android is 6-9. \n Baby animals are in Pocket Edition, but spawn naturally (or with spawn eggs in Creative); animals cannot be actually bred yet. \n Skeletons are significantly less accurate in Pocket Edition than PC or Xbox, making them easier to fight. \n Zombie Pigmen are missing the hat layer of their texture on their heads. This may be intentional. \n A Spider \'s eyes do not glow in the dark. This makes them hard to see in dark places due to their dark brown &amp; black texture. \n Zombie Pigmen are NOT neutral in Pocket Edition. They will attack you on sight, and inflict heavy damage in groups. Considering they only spawn from the Nether Reactor, this means they can be very difficult to fight: You must collect the items as well as deal with the Zombie Pigmen , while in a relatively small space. \n If the player destroys a wooden door by hitting the bottom half of the hinge, two wooden door items are dropped. This was fixed in 0.7.0. \n In Creative mode, there are spawn eggs for passive mobs, but not hostile mobs. This may be because hostile mobs are still aggressive in creative mode, and this is probably going to be changed. \n In 0.7.0, fire sometimes appears a blank black texture or white, and sometimes it appears as the fire texture. At other times, it appears as a bit of both. This was fixed in 0.7.1 \n Before 0.7.0, players on fire would see 2 transparent orange panels in front of their face that resembled the water texture from iPhone versions, or the old water in Minecraft . \n On Kindle Fire, updates won\'t appear until a long time after the update is released, however, due to the Kindle Fire being based off a modified Android OS, if you hold the current MCPE in your menu, and press "Remove from Device", then you can afterwards download any android MCPE update .apk file, tap on it in a file manager that you can download from the appstore, and install it normally, allowing you to play an update before any other Kindle Fire user, provided you find a .apk of an MCPE update download link on the internet or by transferring it from an Android device to a Kindle Fire, using a computer. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Notch and the Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Main menu before 0.7.0 Alpha \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Main menu since 0.7.0 Alpha \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Block selection menu \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A multiplayer server \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Cactus blocks \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The world selection screen before 0.7.0 Alpha \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The options screen in the iOS version before 0.7.0 Alpha \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Mobile zombies and health bar \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n An official SVG of the Minecraft - Pocket Edition logo \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n An image from Minecraft\'s website \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The Zombie Pigman in the game.

It was announced at the 2011 E3 conference by Notch and Microsoft, and was released alongside a free trial version on May 9, 2012 on Xbox Live Arcade. It is priced at 1600 Microsoft Points. [4] \n The Xbox 360 Edition introduces new features such as a simpler crafting system, in-game tutorials , and split-screen multiplayer , as well as online multiplayer for up to eight players over Xbox LIVE. Notch has stated that the Xbox 360 will be the sole console provider of Minecraft . [5] As with all Xbox 360 games, updates are free of charge. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Gameplay \n \n 1.1 Differences from PC edition \n \n \n 2 Release \n \n 2.1 Skin Packs \n \n \n 3 Controls \n \n 3.1 Xbox 360 controller controls \n \n \n 4 Achievements, awards, and unlockables \n 5 Version history \n 6 Issues \n 7 Trivia \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n Gameplay \n \n \n \n  \nIn-game screenshot \n \n \n The objective of the game remains the same as its original computer and Pocket Edition counterparts, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. There is no preset goal; the player may choose to set their own goals. \n For the most part, the Xbox 360 Edition of the game is almost identical to the PC edition but with few apparent differences, [6] but was released in an earlier version equivalent to the PC version Beta 1.6.6 , than the current PC version at the time of release, 1.2.5 . \n Differences from PC edition \n The Xbox 360 Edition was released based on an earlier version of the PC edition ( Beta 1.6.6 ), and therefore lacked some items and features, such as sprinting . The first major update occurred on June 15, 2012, fixing minor bugs and adding minor features; it does not have a PC equivalent. The second major update occurred on October 16, 2012, adding features from Beta 1.8 . \n \n The Xbox 360 Edition doesn\'t make use of the standard crafting interface as in the original version, but still has similarities to the PC\'s 2x2 and 3x3 crafting grids. The interface doesn\'t require the Player to place items in the correct place in a crafting menu, but simply shows the blocks required to craft the selected item, and crafts it if the Player has enough blocks. \n \n \n The game features split-screen functionality, [7] however an HDTV with a Component or HDMI cable is required for Split-Screen play. Split-screen functionality works with a VGA connection to a PC monitor as well as HDMI-to-DVI cables to a PC monitor. Up to 4 players can play in split screen*, as well as the possibility to play 8-person online multiplayer game modes in split-screen. \n \n \n The Xbox 360 Edition includes a tutorial mode not included in the PC version of the game. This tutorial leads the player through the basics of digging and placing blocks , crafting , as well as building their first house to survive the night , fishing , enchanting , brewing , and more. ( video ) \n \n \n You cannot change a world \'s difficulty while in game. You can however change it when you select the world that you want to play. \n \n \n You always begin a new world with a map . \n \n \n Unlike the PC version, each world in the Xbox 360 Edition is currently limited to 864 by 864 blocks. Because the outer-most block is unusable on each side of the map, it is effectively 862 by 862 blocks that can be used. It is expected, but unknown if the world size will be increased along with the updates that will bring the Xbox 360 Edition up to date with the PC version. The PC uses virtual memory which allows to swap chunks in and out of memory, drastically increasing the size of the map. It is unknown if the Xbox has the capability of doing such. \n \n \n Unlike the PC edition in which players have the ability to use any image file as their skin, the Xbox 360 Edition only allows players to choose from one of the skins available as default or from downloadable content . \n Breeding and utility mob spawning works the same as the PC version with the exception of limiting tamed Wolf and Snow Golem populations to 8. If the player attempts to tame or breed a 9th Wolf , it will be killed by other Wolves, and if a player attempts to build a 9th Snow Golem , upon placing the pumpkin all three blocks will break, dropping one pumpkin and eight snowballs. Also, Wolf pups are born with full health and will reach adulthood without player input. \n Snow Golems will attack Creepers in the Xbox 360 version. Be careful when using Snow Golem sentries near your structures as creepers can do damage to both the Snow Golems and nearby structures when exploded. \n The Nether is limited in size and because of this the movement distance in the Nether vs. the Overworld is 1:3 verses 1:8 in the PC version. \n The edge of the world can not be mined and is completely sea. The edge of the map is a strip of water surrounding the map and then an invisible barrier in which all players can not gain access to. This causes problems as some times chest in \'abandoned mine shafts\' generate at the edge of the map, so they are inaccessible. \n In Creative Mode , players can sprint while flying. \n \n Release \n The game was showcased as a playable demo at MineCon 2011 and was deemed a \'work in progress\'. [8] 4J Studios confirmed that it had all the features of the PC version Beta 1.6.6 when released, and will later be updated. IGN also filmed a video at MineCon showing that the graphics look very similar to the PC edition. \n Notch later announced the team developing the game would be 4J Studios . [9] [10] Daniel Kaplan tweeted about receiving an early copy of the Xbox 360 Edition on September 7, 2011. [11] \n In October 2011, Microsoft said the release was planned for Spring 2012. [12] On March 22, the official release date was posted by Larry Hryb , the Director of Programming for Xbox Live, as May 9, [4] and a few days before the game release, HatFilms released the official trailer for the Xbox 360 Edition. \n The game was officially released on May 9, 2012, and set a new sales records on the Xbox Live Arcade, selling more copies in the first twenty four hours of launch than previous titles. [13] \n The retail disc version was released on June 4, 2013, being exactly the same as the arcade version, with the exception of internet requirement to play. \n Skin Packs \n \n Main article: Skin#Skin Packs \n \n 4J Studios plans to produce Skin Packs as downloadable content. Each Skin Pack is said to include 40+ skins to choose from. The first Skin Pack, Skin Pack 1 , was released July 16, 2012 at a cost of 160 Microsoft points. The Skin Pack contains characters from Xbox 360 games, such as Master Chief from Halo . The Skin Pack also include various original designs created by 4J Studios. \n A previously unannounced Skin Pack was released via the Marketplace to promote the Xbox Live Arcade\'s annual "Summer of Arcade" event. The Skin Pack features numerous skins from a variety of arcade games, including characters such as Tony Hawk from Tony Hawk Pro Skater . [14] \n Skin Pack 2 was released on August 24, 2012. \n Skin Pack 3 was released on October 17, 2012. \n The Halloween Skin Pack was released on October 26, 2012.

(Meaning that if you are playing split screen and you are using player 2\'s world, it will transfer ownership of the world to player 1.) \n Taking a screen shot when not playing an online game (unchecking the online checkbox when loading world) will cause the game to disconnect from the server , losing all unsaved data. \n Sometimes when opening the crafting area and either going through, or quitting the crafting tutorial will cause the game to freeze. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j \n

(Tested on Xperia Play only) \n Game Restarts the Device upon opening on Some devices. (Tested Xperia play) \n When trying to craft brick slabs or brick stairs , the game thinks you have one brick, not infinite. \n There are two torch recipes for crafting, however one requires charcoal and is unusable. \n With wooden slabs , the dropped icon and the icon in your hand is a stone slab . \n If you have 1 sand, or a different block or item, a "1" will be next to it. \n Despite having no furnace , iron ore can still be mined and dropped. it appears invisible in your inventory but can be placed in your world. \n Leaf blocks have the texture of crafting table sides when held, do not stack, and have a durability bar. \n In Survival Mode, doors cannot be collected when broken. \n Sugar cane drops its item icon in Creative mode, and you can "pick it up". [17] \n If you drop an axe and two different blocks, the axe symbol shows the infinity symbol instead of a number one after picked up. (other items have been tested and yes it is the same as the axe, and the item turns back to a number one once used again) \n You cannot obtain stone slabs in Survival Mode. \n Swords do not lose durability when used on a mob, only when used to break blocks. \n When the limit of blocks is reached, you can still craft it, but it won\'t give you anything. \n When crafting a wooden door it says it requires four wooden planks and can be crafted without a crafting table, but on Minecraft for PC, it uses six wooden planks using crafting table. \n Lava bug, it starts to spread fire all over your world without stopping. Also with lava bug, it allows water to be set on fire.(major bug) [18] \n On rare occasions, charcoal will drop from coal ore instead of the usual coal . This is the only way to use a seemingly unusable torch recipe. \n Cameras are very glitchy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.2.1 alpha2 (Android) \n March 17, 2012 \n \n \n Major bug fix for some tablet devices and smart Phones in which the game was unable to open. \n Acer Iconia Tab A500 fixed \n \n \n \n \n 0.2.1 \n March 14, 2012 \n \n 0.2.1 (Last Lite Version) \n This is the last release for the Lite version of Minecraft Pocket Edition \n Additions: \n \n New controller option \xe2\x80\x93 Split Touch Controls \n \n This option may be more suitable for devices with larger screens. The cross hair is in the right half of the screen. [19] \n \n \n Mobs\n \n Pigs \n \n \n Added bookshelves in Creative mode \n Sugar cane is now infinite (unable to collect them) \n \n Tweaks: \n \n Flying is changed; ascend/descend by sliding from the center button to the up/down button \n Bigger screens have more hotbar icons \n \n \n \n Bug Fixes: \n \n \n \n \n Blocks now have the \'cracking\' animation when you destroy them \n The circle shown when breaking blocks is sharper \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bugs: \n \n \n \n \n Enabling Split Touch mode once makes MCPE crash (without error message) on starting (old or new) world. Even uninstall/install cycle won\'t help. (Acer Iconia) \n When flying above the height limit in third-person, your avatar disappears. \n When underwater, you can\'t see the breaking animation \n In creative, if you\'re playing in multiplayer and they go into lava or underwater and drown, they die. \n In creative mode, flying above the height limit lets you walk on the edge of the world, on top of the block invisible bedrock found in the files of the game. \n Sometimes in multiplayer, if you a put a block, it puts another block on top of the block you just put. \n When someone dies in multiplayer, rarely they will be invisible and zombies will not attack the invisible player. It\'ll be dead by somethin invisible. \n If you host a game, you will suffer from fall damage but others who join will not take damage when fell. Even if you join a game, you would not suffer but the host of the game will die from fall damage. \n The outer circle while you\'re breaking a block (using normal controls, not split touch) usually disappears. \n You can put cacti on any block as long as it has snow on top of it. [20] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.2.0 (Android) \n February 11, 2012 \n \n Still Called 0.2.0 in the changelog \n \n \n Bug Fixes: \n \n \n \n \n Major bug fix for some phones that crashed while trying to create a new world \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.2.0 \n iOS - February 17, 2012 \n \nAndroid - February 11, 2012 \n \n 0.2.0 \n Survival Update \n \n New Game Modes\n \n Creative (All worlds created before alpha 0.2.0 will be in creative)\n \n You can fly - Press the jump button twice to initiate flight. From there, double press and hold up/down to ascend/descend \n \n \n Survival \n \n Crafting is still not an available feature \n Because of this, stone shovels , stone pickaxes , stone axes , shears , stone swords , ladders , torches , wooden doors , fences , fence gates , wooden planks , Bricks , stone and wooden stairs , stone slabs , and 13 of the 16 colored wool blocks (excluding light gray , magenta , and orange dyes), glass , and leaves are included in survival mode \n The Day-night cycle has been introduced. \n Even though it is Survival , the user can still see the blocks as though s/he were Creative mode, but he cannot use them unless he has gathered some of this material.\n \n This effectively works as the Inventory , but lacks to standard 2x2 crafting grid from the original inventory. \n \n \n Some materials (Tools and anything that can not be naturally acquired) are in infinite stacks which is indicated by \xe2\x88\x9e (infinity) symbols. \n When an item you have 0 of is selected your fist is shown. \n Added Hitpoints Bar same as computer version (health will slowly regenerate, similar to peaceful difficulty in the computer version). \n Added Air Bar when under water (you can now drown and die) \n Added Death with options to respawn or go to main menu. \n Added a day and night cycle with zombies coming out at night. \n When breaking materials, you can gather any material regardless of what tool is used.\n \n For example, you can now break stone with your hand and receive cobblestone , but using a pickaxe is still faster. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n New Mobs \n \n Sheep \n Pig \n Zombie \n \n \n New Blocks \n \n Fence \n Fence Gate \n Wooden Door \n Cactus \n Oak wood is unobtainable and trees now spawn with Dark wood \n \n \n New Tools \n \n Stone Shovel \n Stone Pickaxe \n Stone Axe \n Stone Sword \n Shears \n \n To shear a sheep , you must touch and hold down on the screen, similar to breaking a block. If you do not, you will simply hurt the sheep and eventually kill it (8 hits). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bugs: \n \n \n \n \n When attempting to type in a seed , the virtual keyboard covers up the box you type the seed into and you cannot see what you are typing. \n White wool is unobtainable. \n There is no way to get stone blocks in Survival. \n You can not see the fire when the zombies are burning in the day light. \n You can hit mobs through glass. \n You can not see fence gates when they are selected. \n You can hit mobs through doors when looking through the window part of the door. \n Sugar cane is unobtainable in survival. \n If you place a ladder on a block with a thin snow layer on it and no block behind it, it will be invisible, with its normal hitbox, until a block directly adjacent to it is updated. Then, the ladder will drop as a collectible item (lighting updates via torch do apply). \n When killed by another player, items that weren\'t even obtained by the player will appear (like obsidian, etc.) \n Fences are sometimes invisible when placed close to water \n Block of Iron , Block of Gold , and Block of Diamond are not in the survival mode inventory \n Game crashes when trying to create a new world on some phones. \n Sometimes The forward button doesn\'t work on right handed mode.(Needs Confirmation) \n Sometimes player can\'t pickup items. \n The Trees that grow have a different Wood Block ID (oak) and color than the Wood blocks in your Inventory (pine), thus making it impossible to pick up oak logs. \n Sugar Cane doesn\'t drop when smacked. \n When you break the bottom block of a Cactus it only gives one Cactus block instead of all that were above it as well. \n You cannot place torches on fences. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.1.3 (iOS) \n December 14, 2011 \n \n 0.1.3 (iOS) \n \n Fixed bug with opening dialogs after closing the options menu \n Improvements in network chunk loading \n Added an "Update game!" block used as placeholder for not yet supported block types \n \n \n \n \n 0.1.3 (Android) \n December 3, 2011 \n \n 0.1.3 (Android) \n \n Better tablet support \n Less oversized ingame UI elements \n Performance improvements, especially in Non-Fancy graphics mode \n Added cacti to deserts \n Added Turn Sensitivity setting \n Improvements in network chunk loading \n More sounds in J-version \n \n \n \n Bug Fixes: \n \n \n \n \n Fixed a crash bug when connecting to some iOS server maps \n Fixed blocks placed on snow were added incorrectly in multiplayer \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bugs: \n \n \n \n \n When the game tries to generate a world the green "bar" will freeze and not generate a world on some phones.

Stream Minecraft MCO Beta "I think we will get that in the future", it is planned but he isn\'t sure if he can implement Enchanting. \n \n \n Chat Scrolling [11] \n Johan said he would keep it in mind for future versions. \n \n \n References \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n https://twitter.com/jbernhardsson/status/346906951646580736 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n

[10] Announced on March 2, 2011, [11] it aims to combine elements from trading card games and traditional board game in the strategy genre. It is unknown who else in Mojang is working on Scrolls . In August 2011, Mojang was threatened with legal action by the legal team representing ZeniMax Media , with the accusation being that the title " Scrolls " infringes on the The Elder Scrolls trademark, a series of role-playing video games published by Bethesda Softworks (a ZeniMax Media subsidiary). In mid-October 2011, the court case was won by Mojang, [12] and one employee described the outcome as "the court saw it from our side". No further action will be taken against Mojang, and the name, "Scrolls" will remain. \n \n [ edit ] Cobalt \n \n \n \n  \n Cobalt \n \n \n Cobalt is a game developed by Oxeye Game Studio and published by Mojang.

Cobalt is written in Lua and will be released for Windows , Mac and Linux this autumn, although it will be released for Windows first.

On April Fools\' Day, Mojang launched a satirical website for Mars Effect , citing the lawsuit with Bethesda as an inspiration. [14] However, the gameplay elements remained true and on April 4, Mojang revealed 0x10 c as a space sandbox title.

When Indev was still new, apples were items brought in to replace brown mushrooms to heal health. The player would spawn in an Indev House by a chest containing 99 apples and other tools. In later updates, the chests inside the House were removed, and apples became impossible to find in a map. \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.0.15 \n Apples remained impossible to find (without inventory editing or server /give) until Survival Multiplayer , in which one could be obtained by killing Notch .

They are moderately difficult to obtain, but are one of the most beneficial food items, along with Golden Carrots . They can be crafted, and are very rarely (about 0.66% chance) found in dungeon and stronghold chests . \n Eating a Golden Apple not only restores   , but grants Regeneration for 5 seconds, healing up to 4 (  ) health total. They also give absorption for 2 minutes. Unlike other food items, Golden Apples can be eaten even when the player is full, which will still activate the regeneration effect. \n Golden Apples are required in order to cure Zombie Villagers : While under the effects of a Potion of Weakness , Zombie Villagers can be fed a Golden Apple, which will cure them after a roughly 3-minute delay. They will then revert back to being ordinary Villagers . \n Enchanted Golden Apples are similar to the original, but are much more powerful, much more expensive, and do not occur naturally. They grant Regeneration V (much faster healing) for 30 seconds, and both Resistance and Fire Resistance for 5 minutes (see status effects ). Like the regular golden apple they also give absorption for 2 minutes. Enchanted Golden Apples shine purple, much like other enchanted items. They cannot be used to cure Zombie Villagers. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Crafting \n 2 Advantages \n 3 Disadvantages \n 4 Video \n 5 Trivia \n 6 History \n 7 Gallery \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Crafting \n Normal Golden Apple: \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Apple + \n Gold Ingots \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n   \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Enchanted Golden Apple: \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Apple + \n Blocks of Gold \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n   \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Advantages \n \n They are the only food items that cause temporary constant health regeneration that is not dependent on the player\'s hunger . This is indicated by the line of hearts bobbing up and down in a wave pattern, with each full wave restoring half a heart. \n Compared with potions of regeneration, golden apples are available for fighting monsters before the player is able to brew or even go to the Nether in single player mode. ( Brewing requires Blaze Rods and Nether Wart , both found only in the Nether.) In particular, the enchanted version provides Fire Resistance, which is handy for collecting one\'s first few Blaze Rods . \n Golden apples also are stackable up to 64 (like other food), whereas potions take up an inventory space for each potion. \n Although red apples have a low chance of dropping from oak leaves (0.5% per leaf block), tree farming can produce a good supply of them. Trading with villagers can get them in quantity. \n Golden apples are renewable due to the fact that Gold Ingots can be crafted from Gold Nuggets , which are obtainable through Zombie Pigmen . \n Golden apples can be used to create a village by curing zombie villagers. If Generated Structures are turned off, this is the only way to have villagers and trade with them. \n \n [ edit ] Disadvantages \n \n It takes time to eat, and the basic golden apple then takes 5 seconds to heal 4 HP. Splash potions are a good alternative, if you have brewing capability. \n Compared to a Golden Carrot , the basic Golden Apple restores less food and less saturation. If time is not a factor, and your food level is at least 12 (6 shanks), then a Golden Carrot will bring you up to the normal healing level, rendering the 4 HP of regeneration unnecessary. \n Although they are in a sense renewable, they are still extremely expensive to craft. A single Enchanted Golden Apple requires exactly 72 Gold Ingots (a staggering 648 Gold Nuggets ) along with an Apple which are not altogether common. \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n An enchanted golden apple requires 72 golden ingots to craft; a normal golden apple requires 8 golden ingots to craft. \n Due to this item being able to heal the player a large amount, they are commonly found as rewards in custom adventure maps. \n Enchanted Golden Apples provide the highest level potion effect thus far: Regeneration V. The healing speed is enough to outrace nearly any source of damage short of explosions and falling into the Void . \n Golden apples are the only foods that can still be eaten when the player\'s hunger bar is full. \n Due the Maximum health boost it gives eating a normal golden apple while at full health will allow an unarmored player to survive a fully charged shot from a bow enchanted with level V power though this tactic is risky as it leaves the player with just half a heart. \n In the popular Ultra Hardcore minigame, where natural health regeneration is turned off, the Golden Apple has a critical role as a healing mechanism, as it is the only non-potion item that directly heals the player. \n Because of the very quick regeneration from the Enchanted Golden Apple, a player can get 90 hearts worth of health from the 30 seconds of Regeneration V. \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Infdev \n \n \n February 27, 2010 \n Golden Apples added, they healed a full ten hearts of health, making them the single best food in the entire game-at the expense of being near unobtainable. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.8 \n Due to the addition of hunger, Golden Apples were changed so that they only healed five hunger points, but also gave the status effect of regeneration for 30 seconds. \n \n \n 1.9pre2 \n Golden Apples gained a purple glow when viewed from the player\'s inventory, and its name tag was changed from the standard white to a magenta color. However, Potions of Regeneration were also added, the effects of which lasted longer than that of the Golden Apple. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.1 \n 11w48a \n Golden Apples became easier to craft. Red apples became able to very rarely drop from Oak Leaves, meaning that players no longer have to venture into Strongholds / Dungeons to find one; this caused the golden apple to decrease in value, but also made them easier to obtain. \n \n \n 1.1 \n Golden Apples were changed so that they only healed two hunger and only gave 4 seconds of regeneration. Their crafting recipe was also modified, requiring Gold Nuggets instead of Blocks of Gold to craft. Although its natural spawn is rare, it is easier to obtain through crafting. With now common availability of apples and a cost of 1.24% their former cost in gold, they are for the first time a practical source of healing in Survival. All of these factors make the Golden Apple\'s value decrease greatly. Before, crafting a Golden Apple took 72 gold ingots (8 Gold Blocks ). But after 1.1 it only takes 8/9 of an ingot (eight Gold Nuggets ). \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w21a \n Jeb tweeted that he has "decided to restore Notch\'s old Golden Apple and give it an effect proper for its crafting cost". [1] On Reddit, he clarified that this will be a new item; the existing Golden Apple and its recipe will not change. [2] A new Golden Apple was added, it highly resembles the Golden Apple prior to 1.1, having 30 seconds health regeneration, along with some new features like much faster health regeneration, 5 minutes of resistance and fire resistance. This Golden Apple, crafted with gold blocks, has a purple tooltip and shines like an enchanted item. The other one, crafted with gold nuggets, has a blue tooltip and no shine. \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w32a \n Golden Apples can be fed to a Zombie Villager with the Weakness debuff and they will eventually turn back into Villagers. \n \n \n 1.6 \n 13w23a \n Normal golden apples use ingots instead of nuggets.

Most foods are eaten by holding the right mouse button (PC default). Cake must instead be placed, like other blocks , on a surface before being eaten. A Survival Mode player must eat food items regularly, or they will begin losing health and die soon after. \n With the exception of Golden Apples , food may not be eaten when the hunger bar is completely full. Except for milk , cake , and mushroom stew , food items and ingredients can be stacked in inventory slots. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Hunger vs. Saturation \n \n 1.1 Nourishment value \n \n \n 2 Foods \n \n 2.1 Ingredients \n \n \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Trivia \n 6 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Hunger vs. Saturation \n \n Main article: Hunger#Mechanics \n \n Players have two different food statistics, only one of which is visible: The hunger level (visible), and the saturation level (invisible). \n The saturation level is a primarily invisible statistic. Saturation is the first statistic to decrease when a player performs energy-intensive actions, and it must be completely depleted before the visible hunger meter begins decreasing. Although the current saturation level is generally hidden, you can tell that your saturation level is completely depleted if the visible hunger meter begins displaying a jittering effect. \n Eating food restores both hunger and saturation points in varying ratios, depending on the food item eaten. \n A player\'s current saturation level can never exceed their current hunger level. A player at a hunger level of 5, for example, can only be at a maximum of 5 saturation. This is important to remember when choosing which foods to eat for the most efficient use of food: Highly saturating foods/low hunger-restoring foods should be eaten when the hunger bar is more full, especially when the bar has begun jittering. If you eat highly saturating foods when the bar is low, saturation points are likely wasted, since saturation level can never exceed hunger level. \n The "nourishment" table below can help by categorizing foods by their saturation-to-hunger restoration ratios. See the more detailed Foods table for the exact hunger and saturation statistics of each food. \n [ edit ] Nourishment value \n Nourishment is defined as the ratio of saturation to hunger points restored. Foods with higher nourishment values (the left column) should be eaten when the hunger bar is more full. \n \n \n Value \n Food \n \n \n 2.4 \n      \n \n \n 1.6 \n         \n \n \n 1.2 \n                 \n \n \n 0.6 \n                          \n \n \n 0.2 \n         \n \n \n [ edit ] Foods \n \n \n Name \n Icon \n Food Points \n Source(s) \n Saturation restored \n(additional effects) \n Effective Quality \n [note 1] \n \n \n Apple \n    \n 4   \n Stronghold chests \nDestroyed/despawned oak Leaves \n NPC Village blacksmith chests \n Bonus Chests \n Trading \n 2.4 \n 6.4 \n \n \n Baked Potato \n    \n 6    \n Cooking a potato in a furnace \n 7.2 \n 13.2 \n \n \n Bread \n    \n 5    \n Crafting \n Dungeon chests \n Stronghold chests \n NPC Village chests \n Abandoned Mineshaft chests \n Bonus Chests \n Trading \n 6 \n 11 \n \n \n Cake (slice) \n    \n 2  \n Crafting \n 0.4 \n 2.4 \n \n \n Cake (whole) \n    \n 12      \n Crafting \n 2.4 \n 14.4 \n \n \n Carrot \n    \n 4   \n Killing zombies \nHarvesting carrots \n 4.8 \n 8.8 \n \n \n Cooked Chicken \n    \n 6    \n Cooking a raw chicken \nSetting chickens on fire \n Trading \n 7.2 \n 13.2 \n \n \n Cooked Fish \n    \n 5    \n Cooking a raw fish \n 6 \n 11 \n \n \n Cooked Porkchop \n    \n 8    \n Cooking a raw porkchop \nSetting pigs on fire \n Trading \n 12.8 \n 20.8 \n \n \n Cookie \n    \n 2  \n Crafting \n Trading \n 0.4 \n 2.4 \n \n \n Golden Apple \n    \n 4   \n Crafting \n Dungeon chests \n Stronghold chests \n 9.6 \n( Health regeneration II for 5 seconds and\n absorption for 2 minutes.) \n \n 13.6 \n \n \n Golden Apple (enchanted) \n    \n 4   \n Crafting \n 9.6 \n( Health regeneration V for 30 seconds, absorption\n for 2 minutes, resistance and fire resistance for 5 minutes.) \n \n 13.6 \n \n \n Golden Carrot \n    \n 6    \n Crafting \n 14.4 \n 20.4 \n \n \n Melon \n    \n 2  \n Harvesting a melon block \n Trading \n 1.2 \n 3.2 \n \n \n Mushroom Stew \n    \n 6    \n Crafting \nUsing a Bowl on a Mooshroom \n 7.2 \n 13.2 \n \n \n Poisonous Potato \n    \n 2  \n Harvesting potato plants \n 1.2 \n(60% chance of getting poisoned .) \n 3.2 \n \n \n Potato \n    \n 1  \n Killing zombies \nHarvesting potato plants \n 0.6 \n 1.6 \n \n \n Pumpkin Pie \n    \n 8    \n Crafting \n 4.8 \n 12.8 \n \n \n Raw Beef \n    \n 3   \n Killing cows \n 1.8 \n 4.8 \n \n \n Raw Chicken \n    \n 2  \n Killing chickens \n 1.2 \n(30% chance of food poisoning .) \n 3.2 \n(2.075) [note 2] \n \n \n Raw Fish \n    \n 2  \n Fishing \n 1.2 \n 3.2 \n \n \n Raw Porkchop \n    \n 3   \n Killing pigs \n 1.8 \n 4.8 \n \n \n Rotten Flesh \n    \n 4   \n Killing zombies and zombie pigmen \n Desert and Jungle Temples . \n 0.8 \n(80% chance of food poisoning .) \n 4.8 \n(1.8) [note 2] \n \n \n Spider Eye \n    \n 2  \n Killing spiders and Cave Spiders \n 3.2 \n(100% chance of getting poisoned .) \n 5.2 \n \n \n Steak \n    \n 8    \n Cooking raw beef \nSetting cows on fire \n Trading \n 12.8 \n 20.8 \n \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n Food Points + Saturation, which gives roughly how \'long\' the food will last.

Food also restored a set amount of hearts instantly - a player could return from the brink of death during a fight almost immediately by consuming a few porkchops or bowls of stew . To keep a certain level of challenge to the gameplay, Notch prevented players from taking advantage of this instant recovery by ensuring food (with the exception of the ingredients) did not stack in the inventory. \n When the Hunger Bar was added in Beta 1.8, food became an even more vital resource as the player was required to eat regularly to avoid dying of starvation and regenerate health after taking damage. With the exception of Cake, Milk and Mushroom Stew, food could now stack to 64 in the player\'s inventory. Both types of mushroom could now be farmed by using bone meal on either individual mushroom to produce a Huge Mushroom that dropped more fungi when harvested. \n The first Beta 1.9 pre-release revealed two new sources for mushrooms - an entire biome filled with Huge Mushrooms and the Mooshroom , a strange red cow with red mushrooms growing on its back that could be milked with a bowl to collect Mushroom Stew and shorn to harvest the red mushrooms. However Mooshrooms can only be found in Mushroom Biomes which are extremely rare and difficult to find. \n In the second pre-release of Beta 1.9, Jeb said that Milk now acted as a "clear-everything drink" [1] to nullify the effects of potions and poisons . Spiders also dropped eyes that could be crafted with sugar and a brown mushrooms to produce brewing ingredient, fermented spider eyes . \n In the 1.3 Version, Cocoa Beans , that were once only obtainable from treasure chests in Dungeons and Abandoned Mineshafts were made into a crop that can be farmed, thus making all food items a renewable resource. \n From Minecraft 1.4 (Snapshot 12w34a), potatoes and carrots can be obtainable from zombies (rare drop) or harvested. Potatoes can be cooked to make baked potatoes , and harvesting potatoes may give 0-2 poisonous potatoes . Also, carrots can be crafted into golden carrots . And also in 1.4, Pumpkin Pies are added to the game. These are not cooked, but rather crafted by combining a pumpkin, an egg and sugar. From this, pumpkins are now a food ingredient. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n There is no hunger bar in Pocket Edition . Instead, foods restore health. \n Each and every type of food is fully renewable (including gold food since Zombie Pigmen drop nuggets and ingots of gold). \n You can eat while you are going to sleep, breaking blocks, and climbing vines/ladders. \n When you eat stew, the brown particles of the bowl spray out as well, making it seem like you are eating the bowl. Also, it makes a "chewing" sound effect rather than "slurping" (as milk and potions do) further suggesting you are actually eating the bowl. Despite all this, the bowl is retrieved with no damage whatsoever. \n The player cannot consume anything in Creative mode except milk and potions . \n In 1.5, when eating over water, the particles will all appear as if under water. \n In Pocket Edition, when eating while walking, an interesting bug will happen. If you mouseover a door, it will open and close extremely fast, if you mouseover any type of storage block, it will be entered, blocks in your hand will be constantly placed at a great speed, and snowballs and eggs will be fired at a rapid pace. \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n https://twitter.com/jeb_/status/119842906528944129 \n \n \n \n Items [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Items/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Food&amp;oldid=501681 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Items Food  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 5 July 2013, at 19:16. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

For the entity that items and blocks turn into when dropped, see Item (entity) . \n Items are objects which only exist within the player\'s inventory and hands - i.e., they cannot be placed in the game world. Some items simply place blocks or entities into the game world when used. They are thus an item when in the inventory and a block when placed. Some examples of objects which exhibit these properties are item frames , which turn into an entity when placed, and beds , which turn into a group of blocks when placed. When equipped, items and blocks briefly display their names above the HUD. \n Items use item IDs while blocks use block IDs. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Types \n 2 History \n 3 See also \n 4 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Types \n \n Materials : are used for crafting , farming or brewing and can be obtained by mining , crafting, smelting , trading , killing mobs or found in reward chests . \n \n \n Food is found or crafted by the player and eaten to regain hunger points. \n \n \n Potions are craftable and drinkable (or throwable ) items that confer specific effects. Producing them requires resources from The Nether . In order to create a splash potion, you need to add gunpowder to any normal potion. The change cannot be reversed. \n \n \n Tools are used for a variety of purposes:\n \n The "pole tools" ( axe , pickaxe , shovel , hoe ) are mostly used to break blocks faster than mining by hand, and are required in order to retrieve resources from some blocks. The exception is the hoe , which converts dirt into farmland for growing crops. \n Buckets can transport liquids such as milk , lava , and water . \n Fishing rods allow the player to go fishing, as well as to pull mobs closer. \n Flint and steel is used to set flammable blocks on fire (for varying periods of time) and can be used to create a Nether Portal . A fire charge also gives the same effect, but at greater distance if shot from a dispenser.. \n Shears are used to collect wool from sheep , string from cobwebs , mushrooms from mooshrooms , tall grass , leaves , and vines . They can also be used to collect tripwire without setting off a redstone charge. \n \n \n \n \n Informative items , consisting of map , compass and clock , assist the player in the navigation of the landscape, showing direction and the telling of time. Also book and quills and signs can be used for writing. \n \n \n Weapons ( swords , bows , arrows ) are used to defend the player from hostile mobs roaming a map, or to kill passive mobs for food and materials. \n \n \n Armor protects the player from several kinds of damage ( mobs / players , lava , explosions , being in a fire block). A full set of armor is composed of a helmet , a chestplate , a pair of leggings , and a pair of boots . \n \n \n Vehicles , ( minecarts , saddle , carrot on a stick and boats ) allow the player or items to travel over land or water with relative speed and ease. Variations on minecarts have an assortment of purposes. \n \n \n Utility are used for many tasks, such as logic components in redstone circuits or brewing or enchanting -related things. \n \n \n Decorations are items that only have aesthetic uses. \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n December 11th, 2012 \n Dinnerbone tweeted a picture of diamonds being rendered in 3D as dropped items. [1] He also revealed that other items will also be rendered in this way, but only in fancy graphics .

[1] \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Appearance \n 2 Behavior \n 3 History \n 4 Trivia \n 5 See also \n 6 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Appearance \n Items have two possible appearances, generally corresponding to whether the item appears as a 3D or 2D shape in a player\'s inventory screens. 3D items (typically blocks) appear as their 3D shape, miniaturized to about 1\xe2\x81\x844 scale, slowly rotating and bobbing up and down. 2D items (typically non-blocks) appear as 1\xe2\x81\x842 scale billboards which bob up and rotate (only in fancy graphics); they face the player but only in yaw and not pitch, so when viewed from directly above or below are invisible. \n When a single item entity represents a stack of more than one (which happens when the player discards a stack from an inventory window, or when another like item comes to occupy the same place), it appears as several of the item stuck together. Stacks of 2\xe2\x80\x935 appear as two, 6\xe2\x80\x9320 as three, and 21\xe2\x80\x9364 as four. \n All items appear as 3D items in fancy graphics after snapshot 12w50a. \n [ edit ] Behavior \n Item entities come from many sources. Some common ones are: \n \n The death of a mob or player . \n A block which is mined by a player, destroyed by an explosion (70% loss rate), or washed away by water. \n A block which finds itself in an inappropriate location:\n \n A block attached to another block which was removed (such as a torch , ladder , or sign ). \n A plant in a space not meeting its survival conditions. \n \n \n A falling block ( sand , gravel , anvil , or dragon egg ) which lands in an already-occupied space. \n An inventory item tossed by pressing the toss key (default Q ), dragging a stack outside of an inventory window, or leaving a GUI which does not hold items permanently (such as a crafting table or enchantment table ). \n A container (other than an Ender chest ) with items inside that is destroyed. \n \n Items cannot be attacked (by players or mobs); attempting to do so simply hits what is behind them. However, they may take damage and disappear from environmental or block-based effects such as explosions , fire , lava , a falling anvil , and contact with cactus . Items have essentially no health, so they are destroyed by the slightest damage. The one exception is fire damage from lava ; they may burn briefly before disappearing in that case. \n Items do not react to collisions with other entities; they are only stopped or moved by blocks. However, minecarts or boats encountering any entity, including items, will come to a dead stop. \n If an item is within an opaque block, then: If it is surrounded on all sides by opaque blocks, it will fly out of the top of the block. Otherwise it will fly out one of the unobstructed sides. Note that it will do this even if the space below is unoccupied; therefore, it is possible to recover an item dropped by breaking a hole in a floor by quickly placing another block there. Items are not pushed out by non-opaque blocks such as glass and slabs . \n When an item comes within one block of a player whose inventory is not full, it flies quickly toward them \xe2\x80\x94 regardless of any intervening blocks \xe2\x80\x94 and when it reaches them it is added to their inventory, with a \xe2\x80\x9cpop\xe2\x80\x9d sound. If the item appears in their hotbar, then the hotbar item is briefly animated with a distortion effect. Unlike Experience Orbs , arbitrary numbers of items can be picked up instantaneously. If the player was already within pickup distance when the item was dropped (commonly because that player just dropped it), it may not fly until the player moves slightly. \n Items despawn after 6000 game ticks (5 minutes) of being in a loaded chunk , unless another item of the same kind was dropped next to them and added to its stack. Merging dropped item stacks resets the counter to 6000 ticks . \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Classic \n \n \n 0.24 \n Items were added to the game. Initially, they only took the form of destroyed blocks, and they pulsed white (similar to the selection cursor at the time). [1] \n \n \n ? \n Items no longer pulse white. Items no longer prevent placement of blocks, but instead are pushed out of placed blocks. [ more information needed ] \n \n \n Indev \n \n \n 0.31 \n In a test stage of 0.31, items would not spin and float such as now, but only stands on the block beneath it. [ more information needed ] \n \n \n Non-block items added (as sprites); they rotate to face the player. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.8 \n \n \n \n \n  \n Cactus rendered at a larger scale \n \n \nA bug causing cactus items to be displayed at the 1\xe2\x81\x842 scale rather than 1\xe2\x81\x844 was fixed. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.3 \n Items which are moved into the same location will combine into stacks instead of remaining independent entities. \n \n \n 1.4.3 \n Items are now pushed out of transparent solid blocks as well as opaque ones. [2] Items can push into solid blocks while trying to escape a solid block instead of stopping (this has been used to create vertical transport of items).

Each full heart contains two halves, one hit point each (full health is 20 hit points). \n \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Hearts \n 2 Armor \n 3 Death \n 4 Mob Health \n 5 Achievements \n 6 Video \n 7 History \n 8 Trivia \n 9 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Hearts \n         \n Hearts make up the health meter for the player and mobs in the Survival mode. Each heart represents two hit points, for a total of 20 hit points. Hit points are lost in multiples of one point (i.e. half heart). \n Hit points can be lost by: starving ; taking fall damage ; being attacked by a hostile mob (or another player if PvP is on); being shot with an arrow ; being on fire ; touching lava , fire , or a cactus ; drowning underwater ; suffocating inside a block; falling into the void ; having certain status effects , or getting caught in an explosion . When the health meter shows two hearts or less (20% or less health), it will begin to shake violently, warning that the player\'s demise is imminent if health is not restored. \n Health can be recovered through several means, both "naturally" and through status effects such as potions provide. \n \n The "instant health" potion effect will restore health immediately, the amount depending on the source and effect level. \n On Peaceful difficulty , the health meter will continuously refill over time. \n On other difficulties, health regenerates slowly when the player\'s hunger is at or above        \n The "regeneration" effect makes health regenerate fairly quickly. Aside from potions of regeneration , this is also provided by beacons and golden apples . The "basic" golden apple provides it only for 5 seconds, restoring a total of 4 (  ) . The "enchanted" golden apple provides it for much longer (30 seconds) and at much higher level (level V, over eight times the healing speed of the basic golden apple). (These numbers are as of version 1.6, when both their effects and the speed of regeneration were adjusted.) \n \n As of version 1.6 (snapshot 13w23b) two new status effects can add temporary health, appearing as special hearts added to the health bar: \n \n The "health boost" effect adds 4 (  ) per effect level to the players total health, which is removed when the effect expires. After the effect expires, the player\'s health may remain above the normal maximum, but the extra health will not be recovered once lost to damage. This effect can only be gained through "cheat" commands, prepared command blocks, or mods. At the maximum level of 255, the player has 522 hearts. \n The "absorption" effect likewise adds 4 (  ) for each effect level. This special health cannot be healed or regenerated by normal means, but will be automatically restored every 30 seconds, regardless of the rest of the health bar. Naturally, it will be removed when the effect expires. As of version 1.6, the absorption effect can be gained by eating either type of golden apple . \n \n Damage is split between the health and Armor bars. Each full armor point takes 8% of damage, to a maximum of 80%, rounded up. \n On Hardcore mode, hearts have a different texture (        ) \n In Creative mode the player still has health, but it is hidden from the interface, and the player is invulnerable to everything except falling into the Void or the /kill command. \n [ edit ] Armor \n \n \n \n  \nAn example of a player wearing a full set of leather armor. \n \n \n Armor is a craftable item that can be worn in Minecraft\'s survival mode and survival mode multiplayer that reduces damage to the player while also decreasing the armor\'s durability. Armor can currently be crafted out of Diamond , Iron , Gold , Fire and Leather . \n \n Zombies and Skeletons would occasionally wear armor in Survival Test . This armor, however, did not alter any of their stats, and was purely superficial. In 1.4, Zombies and Skeletons can wear armor when spawning, and can pick up armor off of the ground when the player dies or drops the armor. \n Chain Armor is also craftable, but only by using fire blocks, which cannot be obtained without inventory editing , mods or the /give command , by which you would use /give &lt;player name&gt; 51 &lt;amount&gt; . In survival mode it can be obtained by Trading with a Villager or by killing a skeleton or zombie wearing Chain Armor that is capable of dropping it. \n \n [ edit ] Death \n \n \n \n  \nMobs leaving red corpses and fire (because of day and player-made lightning) in multiplayer. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nExample of Score in Hardcore \n \n \n Death occurs when all of a player\'s hit points are depleted. A "You died!" screen will appear with the player\'s score displayed (before Beta 1.9pre2, it had &amp;e0 as the score), and the player has the option to respawn at the spawn point (either the last bed the player slept in, their default spawn point (their first spawn point in the game), or a spawn point created by commands) or return to the title Menu. In Hardcore Mode , the player cannot respawn and the world will be deleted. Any items and/or blocks that were in the player\'s inventory are dropped from their head and scattered around the spot where the player died. If they come in contact with dangerous blocks - like lava , fire or cactus blocks - they will be destroyed. Otherwise, according to Notch , "they decay after five minutes, except if the chunk is unloaded, in which case they last forever". [1] The player will also lose any experience accumulated reverting the level back to 0. (xp can also be picked up where the player died but only half of it). \n Mobs fall sideways to the ground when killed, as shown in the image. The player falls sideways if you look at him in third person view. On multiplayer, in 1.6.1, the player also falls sideways after killed. \n [ edit ] Mob Health \n \n \n Mob \n Health \n \n \n Playable \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 20 (  \xc3\x97 10) \n \n \n Passive \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 6 (   ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 4 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 10 (     ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 10 (     ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 10 (     ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 10 (     ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 8 (    ) \n \n \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 10 (     ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 20 (  \xc3\x97 10) \n \n \n Neutral \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 40 (  \xc3\x97 20) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 8 (    ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 20 (  \xc3\x97 10) \n \n \n Tameable \n   \n 20 (  \xc3\x97 10) \n  \n 10 (     ) \n \n \n Hostile \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 20 (  \xc3\x97 10) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 12 (     ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 20 (  \xc3\x97 10) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 10 (     ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b (big) \n 16 (       ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b (small) \n 4 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b (tiny) \n 1 (  ) \n \n \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 8 (    ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 20 (  \xc3\x97 10) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b (big) \n 16 (       ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b (small) \n 4 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b (tiny) \n 1 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 16 (       ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 26 (  \xc3\x97 13) \n \n \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 20 (  \xc3\x97 10) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 20 (  \xc3\x97 10) \n \n \n Utility \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 4 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 100 (  \xc3\x97 50) \n \n \n Bosses \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 200 (  \xc3\x97 100) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b \n 300 (  \xc3\x97 150) \n \n \n [ edit ] Achievements \n \n Main article: Achievements \n \n \n \n Icon \n Achievement \n In-game description \n Prerequisites \n Actual requirements (if different) \n Version restriction \n Xbox points earned \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Overkill \n Deal eight hearts of damage in a single hit \n Enchanter \n Deal nine hearts of damage in a single hit (this is a bug). \n PC \n N/A \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n {{History||1.6.1|Added death animations for players in multiplayer mode. \n \n \n Indev \n \n \n \n Before suffocation was implemented, players that were covered by blocks could see through dirt and stone . Suffocation was added after Notch discovered that players were abusing this exploit to find underground caves and hollowed carvings. The patch added suffocation damage and making the player unable to see anything when experiencing it. However, this glitch is not completely fixed and is still possible to be done even in the existing version of the game. \n \n \n In Survival mode, eating a Red Mushroom would deal the player   of damage because they were poisonous. \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.0.4 \n Players no longer suffocate when riding in a minecart . \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.5 \n Unarmed damage was increased from  to  . \n \n \n 1.8 \n Unarmed damage was decreased from  to  . \n \n \n Regeneration effect added, increasing health. \n \n \n 1.9pre1 \n Hearts look different in Hardcore. \n \n \n 1.9pre2 \n Mobs can now have armor points [2] \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0.0 \n The sound of the player taking damage was changed from a masculine "oof! or UGHH!" sound, to a strange crunch. These were changed to remove the restriction that all avatars have a male voice, regardless of the gender of the character depicted in the skin. \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w25a \n Removed the downwards knockback while drowning which essentially trapped drowning players in multiplayer underwater. \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n A bucket of lava is arguably the most effective weapon in the game, as it doesn\'t use up durability, does very fast damage, and slows enemies in their tracks. The only downside is that most of the time the mob\'s dropped loot will disintegrate in the lava. It may also cause nearby trees or wooden buildings to catch fire, possibly even starting vast fires, also it may backfire if the user is hit by the lava and is messy to clear up after use. \n Transparent blocks will not cause suffocation. As a result, placing a slab above a minecart track can be used to make a barrier through which carts can be ridden without allowing mobs (other than 1 block high Chickens , Pigs , tiny Slimes , Silverfish , Cave Spiders , Bats and Wolves ) to wander in.\n \n Using a trapdoor functions similarly, in addition to being able to open the door to pass through on foot. \n \n \n Players deal Critical hits when falling (losing altitude). \n When you die and while you are dead your skin reverts to the default skin . This can be seen by falling from a great height or burning in lava, and checking your inventory moments before death. \n When falling, the player\'s terminal velocity (the fastest speed one can fall at) is theoretically 78.4&#160;m/s (282&#160;km/h), but in fact there isn\'t enough height to reach that velocity\xe2\x80\x94falling from layer 256 to bedrock , they only have time to reach 70&#160;m/s (253&#160;km/h). \n As of 1.5, mobs give different death messages. There is the standard message, like "Player was shot by Skeleton ", a message for when the player dies of fall damage, if the fall damage was a direct result of the mobs attack; "Player was blown from a high place by Creeper " or "Player was knocked from a high place by (Mob Other Than Creeper)". If the player takes the mobs normal form of damage and fall damage within a few seconds of death, the message is "Player was (knocked) from a high place and got finished off by Mob".

Instead of directly restoring the player\'s health as it did prior to the Adventure Update, eating food now fills up the food bar, which is constantly drained by the player \'s actions. The food bar is located opposite to the player\'s health bar on the bottom of the screen and is represented by ten drumsticks. \n         \n While the player is sprinting , the food bar depletes much faster. The player is not able to sprint if their food level is 6 (   ) or less. \n The food bar does not drain when playing on Peaceful mode . However, its effects on the player\'s health level remain, and switching difficulties has no effect on the Food Bar\'s current level. Thus, if the player changes the difficulty level to Peaceful while his or her Food Bar is empty, it will not restore his or her hunger level and the player will continue to starve while healing. \n Certain foods have a chance of inflicting Hunger on the player upon consumption, which causes the player\'s hunger to deplete faster. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Effects \n 2 Food poisoning \n \n 2.1 Behavior \n \n \n 3 Mechanics \n \n 3.1 Exhaustion level increase \n 3.2 Food level and saturation level restoration \n \n \n 4 Video \n 5 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Effects \n \n When the Food Bar is at 18 (  &#160;\xc3\x97 9) points or above, the player\'s health will slowly regenerate at a rate of 1 health point every 4 seconds. [1] \n If the Food Bar is at 6 (   ) points or below, then the player will not be able to sprint. \n When the Food Bar is at 0 (  ) , the player\'s health will deplete at a rate of 1 (  ) every 2.5 seconds (this makes sleeping impossible). On easy difficulty , the player\'s health stops dropping at 10 (     ) , on normal it stops at 1 (  ) , and on hard it keeps draining until either the player eats something or starves to death. [2] \n \n [ edit ] Food poisoning \n        \n Hunger , or food poisoning, is an effect induced by eating certain foods, which turns the food bar a sickly yellow-green and drains food more rapidly. The only foods, however, to inflict Hunger is rotten flesh , which can cause Hunger 80% of the time, and raw Chicken , which causes Hunger only 30% of the time. Eating a spider eye or poisonous potato actually deals the player Poison . The rest of the foods will not cause food poisoning. \n \n \n Name \n Icon \n Chance to poison \n \n \n Raw Chicken \n    \n 30% \n \n \n Rotten Flesh \n    \n 80% \n \n \n [ edit ] Behavior \n Hunger from eating food lasts 30 seconds and adds 15.0 to the player\'s exhaustion level over the duration. This is slightly less than   . In Peaceful mode, the food bar will change color, but will not drain out. Green-like swirls will also emit from the player, indicating that the player is food poisoned. \n The duration of Hunger do not stack. So, if the player eats many poisonous foods at once, he or she will only feel the negative effects of the most recent poisonous food, plus the consumption time of each other food. Also, drinking milk will negate the effect, allowing the player to potentially eat more poisonous food and constantly drink milk to fill the bar without being inflicted by Hunger. \n Also, passing through a nether portal in SMP will negate the effect (this does not happen in SSP ). \n [ edit ] Mechanics \n There are four fields in level.dat which are related to hunger: \n \n foodLevel ranges from 0 to 20 and is represented by the player\'s Food Bar. One point equals  (half a "chicken leg"). \n foodSaturationLevel is an invisible additional hunger variable that is depleted before main foodLevel value. Eating any food will also add some to this variable. Note that this cannot exceed foodLevel , and therefore maximum value is 20. The Food Bar jitters when this equals 0. \n foodTickTimer increases with every tick when foodLevel is either greater than 17 or equals zero. When foodTickTimer reaches 80, it resets to zero and then heals or deals one point of damage to the Health Bar, respectively. \n foodExhaustionLevel ranges from 0.0 to 4.0 and increases with every action the player takes. When the exhaustion level reaches above 4.0, it will be subtracted by 4.0 and subtracts 1 point either from foodSaturationLevel or, if foodSaturationLevel equals zero, from foodLevel . \n \n [ edit ] Exhaustion level increase \n Any action not listed here will not increase exhaustion level. For example, the player can travel several days by boat and the food bar will not decrease. \n \n \n Action \n Exhaustion Level increase \n \n \n Walking and Sneaking \n(per meter) \n 0.01 \n \n \n Sprinting (per meter) \n 0.1 \n \n \n Swimming (per meter) \n 0.015 \n \n \n Jumping \n 0.2 \n \n \n Sprinting jump \n 0.8 \n \n \n Breaking a block \n 0.025 \n \n \n Attacking an enemy \n 0.3 \n \n \n Receiving any damage \n 0.3 \n \n \n Effects of food poisoning \n 0.5 per second (15.0 over effect duration) \n \n \n Regenerating 1 health point from being well-fed \n 3.0 \n \n \n [ edit ] Food level and saturation level restoration \n \n Main article: Food \n \n \n \n Name \n Icon \n Food Points \n Source(s) \n Saturation restored \n(additional effects) \n Effective Quality \n [note 1] \n \n \n Apple \n    \n 4   \n Stronghold chests \nDestroyed/despawned oak Leaves \n NPC Village blacksmith chests \n Bonus Chests \n Trading \n 2.4 \n 6.4 \n \n \n Baked Potato \n    \n 6    \n Cooking a potato in a furnace \n 7.2 \n 13.2 \n \n \n Bread \n    \n 5    \n Crafting \n Dungeon chests \n Stronghold chests \n NPC Village chests \n Abandoned Mineshaft chests \n Bonus Chests \n Trading \n 6 \n 11 \n \n \n Cake (slice) \n    \n 2  \n Crafting \n 0.4 \n 2.4 \n \n \n Cake (whole) \n    \n 12      \n Crafting \n 2.4 \n 14.4 \n \n \n Carrot \n    \n 4   \n Killing zombies \nHarvesting carrots \n 4.8 \n 8.8 \n \n \n Cooked Chicken \n    \n 6    \n Cooking a raw chicken \nSetting chickens on fire \n Trading \n 7.2 \n 13.2 \n \n \n Cooked Fish \n    \n 5    \n Cooking a raw fish \n 6 \n 11 \n \n \n Cooked Porkchop \n    \n 8    \n Cooking a raw porkchop \nSetting pigs on fire \n Trading \n 12.8 \n 20.8 \n \n \n Cookie \n    \n 2  \n Crafting \n Trading \n 0.4 \n 2.4 \n \n \n Golden Apple \n    \n 4   \n Crafting \n Dungeon chests \n Stronghold chests \n 9.6 \n( Health regeneration II for 5 seconds and\n absorption for 2 minutes.) \n \n 13.6 \n \n \n Golden Apple (enchanted) \n    \n 4   \n Crafting \n 9.6 \n( Health regeneration V for 30 seconds, absorption\n for 2 minutes, resistance and fire resistance for 5 minutes.) \n \n 13.6 \n \n \n Golden Carrot \n    \n 6    \n Crafting \n 14.4 \n 20.4 \n \n \n Melon \n    \n 2  \n Harvesting a melon block \n Trading \n 1.2 \n 3.2 \n \n \n Mushroom Stew \n    \n 6    \n Crafting \nUsing a Bowl on a Mooshroom \n 7.2 \n 13.2 \n \n \n Poisonous Potato \n    \n 2  \n Harvesting potato plants \n 1.2 \n(60% chance of getting poisoned .) \n 3.2 \n \n \n Potato \n    \n 1  \n Killing zombies \nHarvesting potato plants \n 0.6 \n 1.6 \n \n \n Pumpkin Pie \n    \n 8    \n Crafting \n 4.8 \n 12.8 \n \n \n Raw Beef \n    \n 3   \n Killing cows \n 1.8 \n 4.8 \n \n \n Raw Chicken \n    \n 2  \n Killing chickens \n 1.2 \n(30% chance of food poisoning .) \n 3.2 \n(2.075) [note 2] \n \n \n Raw Fish \n    \n 2  \n Fishing \n 1.2 \n 3.2 \n \n \n Raw Porkchop \n    \n 3   \n Killing pigs \n 1.8 \n 4.8 \n \n \n Rotten Flesh \n    \n 4   \n Killing zombies and zombie pigmen \n Desert and Jungle Temples . \n 0.8 \n(80% chance of food poisoning .) \n 4.8 \n(1.8) [note 2] \n \n \n Spider Eye \n    \n 2  \n Killing spiders and Cave Spiders \n 3.2 \n(100% chance of getting poisoned .) \n 5.2 \n \n \n Steak \n    \n 8    \n Cooking raw beef \nSetting cows on fire \n Trading \n 12.8 \n 20.8 \n \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n Food Points + Saturation, which gives roughly how \'long\' the food will last.

The loss comes from saturation before visible hunger. \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.minecraftforum.net/news/192-an-interview-with-jeb/ \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://twitter.com/jeb_/status/111047534318858240 \n \n \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Hunger&amp;oldid=501282 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Category : Gameplay  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 4 July 2013, at 17:50. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

For the game mode, see Adventure . \n \n  \n \n \n \n The Adventure Update was a major update to Minecraft focused on fighting, exploration, and adventuring, as well as other aspects. Its content was implemented in Beta 1.8 and Minecraft 1.0 . It was announced on June 10, 2011 by Notch and was initially planned to be implemented in Beta 1.7. [1] An early version of the Adventure Update was playable by fans at Mojang \'s booth at PAX Prime 2011, which was held between August 26 th and 28 th . [2] Because of the size of the content, the first part of the update was pushed back to Beta 1.8, which became available on the 14 th of September 2011 and the rest of the update being part of Minecraft 1.0, which was released on November 18, 2011. The Pre-Releases of Minecraft Beta 1.8 and 1.9 were leaked before their official releases, and Notch approved these leaks on his twitter.

They return in Minecraft 1.0. \n \n \n New ocean floor; random mix of sand , dirt , and clay .\n \n Because of this, clay is much more common. \n \n \n \n \n New combat Mechanics.\n \n Hold-to-charge bows . \n Critical hits. \n Players can parry with a sword by holding Right Mouse \n Hostile mobs perform attack animations. \n Mobs killed by players drop tiny flashing Experience Orbs that add to your experience bar. \n \n \n New Food System.\n \n There is now a food meter.\n \n Food no longer heals directly but indirectly: if the food meter is above 80%, heals  about every 5 seconds. \n \n \n All food (except Mushroom Stew) are now stackable. \n Food takes 1.6 seconds to consume, accompanied with an animation. \n 5 new food items.\n \n Melons . \n Raw Chicken . \n Raw Beef . \n Cooked Chicken . \n Steak , which has Cooked Porkchop \'s old texture. Cooked Porkchops\' new texture is a tan shade of the same sprite. \n \n \n Eating Raw Chicken or Rotten Flesh has a chance to give the player food poisoning . \n \n \n New seeds for farming : pumpkin seeds and melon seeds that produce Pumpkins and Melons respectively. \n A new achievement : "Kill a skeleton with an arrow at 50 meters". \n Added Sprinting \n Mob changes\n \n Passive mobs will randomly flee if attacked by the player or other mobs (such as Wolves ). \n Zombies drop Rotten Flesh instead of Feathers . \n The snout on pigs now protrude from their head. \n Skeletons now hold full-size bows. \n Player-to-mob damage decreased by half a heart. \n Arrows that hit a mob visually "stick" into the mob rather than just disappear.\n \n Skeleton arrows originate from about their eyes to the bow, instead of above the head. \n \n \n Animals no longer despawn which makes it possible to capture them. \n \n \n Shears can now collect Tall Grass and the new Vine \n New improved lighting \n \n Day/night cycles no longer require chunk updates and is a smooth transition \n The lighting on a block is given a tint based on the most prominent source of light\n \n Redish from Non-sunlight light sources \n Blue from Moonlight \n Total darkness keeps the same black tint \n Sunlight gives the same white tint \n \n \n \n \n Non-sky based light now gives a very subtle \'flicker\'. \n Main Menu/Options changes\n \n The Main Menu\'s background is now an animated scene. \n The version tag is now displayed on the bottom-left rather than the top-left \n New sliders for Field of View and Brightness \n 4 new entries in control list\n \n "Attack", "Use Item", and "Pick Block" can now be remapped. \n Player list in SMP, defaults to Tab \xe2\x86\xb9 . \n \n \n The \'Multiplayer join screen\' has been improved, mainly with a server list . \n \n \n New texture for Moss Stone to match Cobblestone \'s. \n Improved sunrise and sunset.\n \n Clouds change color during sunrise and sunset to match the sky color. \n Horizon, specifically haze, changes color more vividly during sunset and sunrise. \n \n \n New particle effects.\n \n Performing a critical hit on any mob will cause \'sparks\' to fly. \n Explosion particles are now shockwaves instead of smoke. \n Tiny stationary bubble particles can be seen when underwater. \n Fog is now thicker and darker deep underground, and gives off particles. Due to this, the void appears black. \n \n \n Changes with debug-view ( F3 )\n \n Mobs are no longer visibly labeled with their entity ID \n The world\'s numeric seed is displayed in a field below player position. \n Changing fog by hotkey now requires debug-view to be open in addition with pressing F . \n \n \n \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift +Clicking the output item in a crafting square will craft all the items at once, and automatically places them in the inventory. \n The version tag appears in-game again. \n User-placed leaf blocks no longer decay. \n Cloud height raised to the top of the map, so clouds can no longer phase through blocks. \n Cloud movement syncs with the game\'s time. \n Rain and snow both render faster \n Armor bar moved to above hearts, due to food bar. \n Both Wooden and Stone pressure plates can now be placed on fences . \n Improved chest model with a 3D lock. \n Players with the OP position on a server can switch back and forth between survival and creative mode. [4] \n The game\'s coding now allows for mods to more easily change the( map ) height. \n Holding the left mouse button with a weapon will now only swing once. \n Holding the right mouse button to place blocks is slightly slower than before. \n \n Bug Fixes: \n \n The \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift +Click crash bug from beta 1.8 pre2 is fixed. \n Fixed Redstone circuits not working after /time set x glitch is now fixed in SMP. \n Destroying boats and minecarts now creates particles. \n Ghast attack sounds are fixed in SMP. \n The Far Lands had been removed; there is now only ocean. [5] \n \n New bugs: \n \n There is a memory leak mainly occurring on Linux 32 bit. \n The destruction animation for chests is missing. \n Lighting persists in water even after the light source is removed. \n Experience orbs when dropped don\'t drop in a stack like items do, so when a player dies when they have a large number of experience, each orb has to be processed individually. This will cause a high amount of lag, especially for SMP servers. \n Double chests placed before beta 1.8 on multiplayer servers all appear to players to be facing the same direction, even when they should be rotated by 90 degrees. \n The Item Selection screen in the new Creative game mode is missing pine and birch leaves, tall grass, double slabs, monster spawner, snow cover, and both huge mushroom blocks. \n NPC villages occasionally spawn over partial water areas and \'float\' \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Trailer \n \n Leading up to the release of the Adventure Update, a trailer documenting some of its major features was released on Mojang \'s official YouTube channel on the 6 th of September 2011. The trailer was made by Hat Films. \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Reception \n Because so many things were added and changed in Beta 1.8, it was criticized by many in the community. [6] One of the most criticized changes was the new terrain generation system. If the player loads a pre-Beta 1.8 world and explore new chunks , the world can become corrupted, causing large walls of land to generate where new and old chunks meet, and caves to abruptly stop and start. [7] This also meant that old seeds will not work. \n Another criticized feature was the Hunger system, which, according to some players, makes the game more challenging because hunger goes down at a rate considered to be too fast. Alternatively, other players believe it just adds tedium to the game as food is over abundant in the world, and eating most food has no negative effects on the player. Other criticism included non-hostile mobs running away when you hit them, making the collection of materials more difficult. Although saying that, other people think this makes the game more interesting, and Notch agreed that \'Cows would just stand there, looking at me as I mashed them over and over to get their precious loot\' and it needed to be more fun. [8] \n Some people also claimed that the game has become overly complicated, and that Minecraft is now more of a combat/ survival game rather than the simple construction game of the earliest versions. \n Conversely, others praised the features implemented and noted that they made the game more exciting and challenging. Many players approved the inclusion of a long awaited Creative mode, a game mode that removed all survival aspects of Minecraft and allowed players to focus solely on building if they wished to do so.

For the update, see Adventure Update . \n Adventure mode is a game mode intended for player-created maps by limiting some of the gameplay in Minecraft, in which the player cannot directly destroy most blocks to avoid spoiling adventure maps or griefing servers. Most blocks cannot be destroyed without the proper tools (axe:wood; pickaxe:stone). However, players can still interact with mobs and craft items. \n While it is possible to play a "regular" survival Minecraft game in adventure mode, it is quite difficult to do so. Most of the time is spent collecting food to replenish the food bar . Because players cannot immediately collect blocks, players usually do not have time to construct a shelter before the first night. For this reason, it is essential for players to search for NPC Villages or any other structures that are safe from hostile mobs. It is recommended that beginners enable cheats or bonus chests before creating a world. \n Command blocks are intended for use in adventure mode gameplay. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Features \n 2 Uses and Tips for Adventure Mode \n 3 Tools \n 4 Video \n 5 History \n 6 Issues \n 7 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Features \n \n Most blocks cannot be destroyed by hand, and require corresponding tools(See below). \n Interaction with mechanisms as well as trading is allowed. \n Compatible in multiplayer . \n The gamemode is not accessible when first creating a world, but is through cheats , by typing /gamemode 2 &lt;playername&gt;, /gamemode a (playername) or /gamemode adventure &lt;playername&gt; \n Use of Modding API . [1] \n \n [ edit ] Uses and Tips for Adventure Mode \n \n You can use it as a useful way to protect your server from griefing, but beware! You can use the following tools to break the following blocks in Adventure Mode! \n \n \n Because of these breakables, you may want to keep tools out of the wrong hands until you get a protection plugin! \n \n \n Adventure Mode can be used for adventure maps, and the breakables can add an interesting feeling to the map. If you only want your map-players to have a tool at a certain point of time, you can connect a pressure plate with /clear @p(or @a for all players) &lt;itemID&gt;. \n \n [ edit ] Tools \n This shows what tools are used to mine what. \n \n Anything \n \n \n Glass \n Glass Panes \n Ice \n Glowstone \n Redstone Lamps \n Redstone, Redstone Torches, Repeaters and Comparators \n All Plants, Crops and Mushrooms (excluding Grown Trees, Pumpkin Blocks and Melon Blocks) \n Buttons, Tripwire Hooks, Levers \n Natural Snow \n Rails \n Heads \n Ladders \n Pots \n Paintings and Item Frames \n Vines \n \n \n Axe \n \n \n Wood \n Bookshelves \n Planks \n Crafting Tables \n Wooden Doors \n Chests \n \n \n Pickaxe \n \n \n Stone \n Stone Bricks \n Sandstone (all types) \n Furnaces \n Dispensers \n All ores (wooden pickaxe can break, but not necessarily harvest, all) \n Obsidian \n Iron Doors \n All resource blocks \n Cobblestone \n Ender Chests \n \n \n Shovel \n \n \n Dirt \n Grass Blocks \n Gravel \n Sand \n \n \n Shears \n \n \n Cobwebs \n All Wool \n All Leaves \n \n \n Swords \n \n \n Cobwebs \n Jack O\' Lanterns \n All Leaves \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n \n Adventure mode, formerly Dungeons and Levers , was announced by Notch on July 7, 2010. [2] Notch hinted at four players to compete in Adventure mode. Adventure mode may include permadeath like in Hardcore mode, making it rogue-like in nature, [3] and may have a quest system with randomly generated maps/quests. [4] \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w22a \n Added Adventure mode. Accessible through the cheats command, /gamemode 2 &lt;playername&gt; or /gamemode adventure &lt;playername&gt;. It is still possible to craft in Adventure mode both with the 2x2 crafting grid in the player\'s inventory and with the full sized 3x3 crafting table . The player can still interact with blocks with an interface, such as chests , dispensers , crafting tables , furnaces and brewing stands . The player can also go through portals , but cannot activate one by using flint &amp; steel ; flint &amp; steel can be used to activate TNT . \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w34a \n Certain blocks can now be removed and placed again with correct tools.

For instructional material, see Tutorials . \n \n \n \n  \nA sunset in a taiga biome . \n \n \n Gameplay in most game modes of Minecraft consists mainly of adding and destroying a variety of different blocks in a randomly generated world. \n With these blocks, players can manipulate the world around them, building and destroying structures. As gameplay in Minecraft is so open and unguided, players often set their own goals and play the game as they see fit. An example of this is the Minecraft sport, Spleef . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Game modes \n \n 1.1 Survival \n 1.2 Creative \n 1.3 Adventure \n 1.4 Hardcore \n \n \n 2 Table of game modes \n 3 Video \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Game modes \n \n \n Animation showing the different game modes \n \n \n The four game modes in Minecraft are Survival, Creative, Adventure and Hardcore. In the level.dat , Survival mode is gametype=0, Creative is gametype=1 and Adventure is gametype=2. Hardcore is Survival with the addition of hardcore=1 (for Survival and Creative, hardcore=0). This knowledge allows hacking to change game modes by editing the world\'s level.dat. The command "/gamemode" can be used to switch between these. Example: "/gamemode 1" would put you into creative mode. \n [ edit ] Survival \n \n Main article: Survival (game mode) \n \n In this mode, players have to gather all their materials to build, craft and gain experience points. There is a health , hunger and armor bar, an inventory and, when underwater , an oxygen bar . \n [ edit ] Creative \n \n Main article: Creative (game mode) \n \n The player will have access to an infinite amount of almost all blocks and items available, and can destroy them instantly. Players are invulnerable and do not have health, armor, or hunger, and can fly . The player has access to items not available in Survival mode, e.g. spawn eggs . \n [ edit ] Adventure \n \n Main article: Adventure \n \n Players can interact with objects such as levers and buttons , and can interact with mobs . However, they can only break blocks with the correct tools ([dirt broken with the shovel]or[stone broken with the pickaxe]) , making this mode good for adventure maps. Although this game mode has been released, it is still in its early stages, lacking in many features including the ability to toggle the use of tools by players. \n [ edit ] Hardcore \n \n Main article: Hardcore \n \n In this mode, which plays in the same way as Survival mode, the difficulty level is permanently set to "Hard" and the map must be deleted upon the player\'s death. \n Technically, Hardcore is a game mode modifier rather than a game mode. However, without cheating, it is only possible to get "Hardcore Survival". To attain "Hardcore Creative" mode, the player must edit the game world with external tools, or opening to LAN, and enabling cheats. There is almost no visible difference between "Hardcore Creative" and "Non-Hardcore Creative", because in Creative mode the only way to die is to fall into the Void. Because of this, "Hardcore" usually refers to "Hardcore Survival". On a server, if someone dies, they will be banned. If everyone on a server gets banned, the world for the server will be deleted. \n [ edit ] Table of game modes \n Below is a brief summary of the different available features in each game mode. This table also includes Classic , which is the older, free version of Minecraft . \n \n \n Feature \n Classic \n Survival \n Creative \n Adventure \n Hardcore \n \n \n Premium account \n Not required \n Required for multiplayer [fn 1] \n Required \n Required \n Required \n \n \n Available \n Partial [fn 2] \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Multiplayer \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Crafting \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Smelting \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Brewing \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Enchanting \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Inventory \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Health \n No \n Yes \n Partial [fn 3] \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Respawn after death \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n No \n \n \n Block Placing/Breaking \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Partial \n Yes \n \n \n Mobs \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n Unlimited Blocks \n Yes \n Partial [fn 4] \n Yes \n No \n Partial [fn 4] \n \n \n Day-night Cycle \n No \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n Yes \n \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n The demo allows gameplay of only the Survival gamemode without a premium account, and only in singleplayer. \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n Classic mode is no longer supported, but it is still accessible from the \'Looking for Classic?\' button \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n In Creative, health is still there but hidden from GUI, you can show this by falling into the Void . \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 a  b \n In Survival, there are methods to obtain unlimited amounts of specific renewable resources such as wood , cobblestone , and water .

By doing this, you will have plenty of time to gather resources and create a shelter for the night, and monsters will not come up and kill you while you are away. \n Before you start, you should learn the controls for the game. A full discussion of controls on all platforms can be found on, naturally, the Controls page. Here we discuss the default PC (and Mac) controls. Most of these can be changed in the Options menu (which can be reached from either the main menu or the pause ( Esc ) menu. There is one case (see below) where you really do want to change the default....) \n The default keys for movement are as follows: \n \n w moves forward (double-tap and hold to sprint) \n a moves left \n s moves back \n d moves right \n space to jump. If in deep water, Hold space to swim upwards so you can breathe. \n \xe2\x87\xa7 Left Shift to crouch/sneak (hold to prevent falling off blocks and sliding down ladders) \n \n As you do various things, you will see "items" appear and float just off the ground. As you move toward them (or if you\'re already very close to them), they will fly toward you and disappear into your inventory. Later you will have chests to store things in, but for the first day or so, your inventory will be plenty big enough for all the items you find. \n Use the mouse to look around the world, and to act on blocks: \n \n Moving the mouse changes the direction you are looking, without moving your character. (That is, looking around is always safe, Endermen notwithstanding.) \n Click and hold the left mouse button to break down (or mine) blocks. This is how you collect resources from the environment. Rapid clicking does not work, even though it may seem to. \n Right click to place or use the currently highlighted item from your inventory hot bar. Blocks and items such as torches get placed where your cursor is pointing (if possible), while other (non-mining) tools will do their various "things". Right-click and hold to eat food , or (when you have one) draw your bow. \n The mouse wheel cycles through the currently held item in your inventory hot bar, or you can use the number keys 1 \xe2\x80\x93 9 . \n E opens your inventory window, which lets you arrange your items and decide what goes on the hotbar. See the inventory page for full details. \n Q will drop whatever item you are holding. You should probably change the drop key to something else, like G . This is because the Q key is right next to the movement keys, which makes it all too easy to throw away your tools, perhaps dropping them off a cliff, into the ocean, or even into lava. Regardless of the key setting, you can also drop items by opening your inventory, and dragging the items out of the inventory window. \n \n \n F1 will toggle the HUD (Heads Up Display), including your hotbar, the various other "bars" (health, food, experience, armor), debug info , and the item you are holding. This gives you a clear view of the scene. \n F2 will take a screenshot, which is saved in the directory \xe2\x80\x9c .minecraft\\screenshots \xe2\x80\x9d. If the HUD and/or debug info are visible, they will be included in the screenshot. \n F3 will toggle " debugging info ". A lot of this will be cryptic and pretty useless, but the information includes your current coordinates in the world, and the biome you are currently in. \n F5 will cycle among first-person view (the default), third-person view (looking at the avatar from behind), and second-person view (looking toward the avatar\'s face). \n \n \n F3 + F will cycle through four levels of render distance . This chooses the distance you can see, with anything beyond that distance being enveloped by "fog". Shorter render distance (closer fog) can increase frames per second on a slow machine, but it prevents you from seeing as far as you potentially could, including mobs or distant territory. It\'s perfectly fair to spend most of your time on Short or even Tiny render distance, and switch briefly to a longer setting when you need to look over the landscape. There are four different view distances: \n \n \n Far : you can see the maximum distance (around a 256 block diameter). \n Normal : you can see about half of your maximum range (around a 128 block diameter). \n Short : this prevents you from determining what time of day it is as it blocks the sun, so this is not suggested. If your Minecraft client is this slow, try the Optifine Mod. You can only see about thirty-two blocks away from you (around a 64 block diameter). \n Tiny : same as short fog but you can only see sixteen blocks away. It is extremely difficult to play this way, and thus this fog distance is not suggested for any player except the very experienced for a challenge or if your computer is slow and you want to maximize performance (around a 32 block diameter). \n \n \n Note: When you eventually go deep underground, you will see the Void Fog , which behaves similarly, but closes in the further down you go, and is unaffected by your view settings. \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe default controls in the options menu( Esc ). \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Initial priorities \n [ edit ] Overview \n As Minecraft is a sandbox game, there is no defined or proper way and style to play the game. However, in Survival mode one common theme found for all players is the need to feed yourself, and to avoid (and later, fight) hostile mobs that spawn either in dark places (e.g. caves) or when night falls. \n For your first night, you will need Wood , Cobblestone , and, ideally, Coal or Charcoal to have a fighting chance. Wool for a bed is optional, but very helpful -- it lets you skip the night and avoid the monsters that appear then. While you\'re working on the basics, collect any stray items you come across, as many of them will be useful later. (Notably eggs , seeds , and anything dropped by monsters e.g Zombie Flesh, Bones and Arrows.) \n You need to get your resources and find or make either a bed or a shelter before nightfall, because that\'s when the monsters come out. It is best to work quickly, as a Minecraft day is approximately ten minutes and night is ten minutes, including dawn and dusk. \n [ edit ] First Shelter \n The traditional advice is to build your first shelter as close as possible to the spawn point, so if you die, you can easily find it again, or even spawn in a now-protected area. However, recent versions of the game have altered the rules for respawning, so that this is not necessarily a good idea. \n When you die in Minecraft, all items you were carrying or wearing in your inventory are scattered around your point of death, while you respawn elsewhere. In prior versions, a player in a singleplayer game (SSP) would reliably spawn at the same location they originally appeared. However, since version 1.3, even SSP players instead spawn somewhere within 10 blocks of the normal spawn point (until they\'ve slept in a bed ). This includes the first time when you started the game, so it\'s much harder to know just where you\'ll be coming back. \n Like any dropped items in Minecraft, your scattered inventory will disappear after 5 minutes unless you\'re more than 180 blocks or so away, that is outside of chunk update radius . The problem is that if you died at night, you will find yourself stranded without your weapons and armor, at night, so you are quite likely to get killed again, or at least find your stuff guarded by monsters. Meanwhile, some of the monsters can actually pick up your stuff and use it against you! And if you spawned near your death scene, that 5-minute timer can easily go by before you can actually get back to and keep your stuff. \n Combining these issues leads to a new strategy, at least for single-player. You can still mark your spawn point, but realize you might end up anywhere within 20 blocks of that. Then, while getting your initial resources, move away from the spawn point, trying to get 200 blocks or so away before you build your shelter. ([[ Using the debug screen can help with checking the distance.) That way, if you get killed at night, you might spend an unpleasant "evening", but if you wait until dawn comes and the monsters leave, you can trot right back and hopefully retrieve your dropped items. \n Note the above only applies until you have made and used a bed in a secure shelter. Once you\'ve done that, you have a new option: If you get killed at night, you will respawn next to your bed, so you can just go back to sleep, and wake up the next morning -- the items don\'t "expire" while you\'re asleep.. It still may be worth keeping your bed out of chunk update range from where you\'re endangering yourself, but at least you won\'t be stranded outside at night. \n Note that in multiplayer, this is much less reliable, because if another player is nearby, they will keep the chunk loaded. Of course, they can also take the items to save for you... or to keep for themselves. \n [ edit ] Early priorities \n Once you have shelter, your next priority will be food . Hunger will take a while to hit, so it shouldn\'t be a problem on your first day, but you\'ll try to pick up some food for when it does. After you\'ve been moving around for a while, your food bar will begin rippling and start to decrease. If it drops below 90%, you will not regenerate health, and if it gets to 30%, you can not sprint. If the hunger bar goes down to empty, you will begin losing health. Unless you\'re in Hard Mode (and a beginning player shouldn\'t be), you can\'t actually die of hunger, but you will go down to 1 hit point 1 (  ) , which makes you very vulnerable. \n For nighttime, the primary danger will be monsters. It is a good idea to start gathering resources and construct a lit shelter immediately after you begin on the first day. As a beginning player, do not try to fight monsters your first night, because you have poor weapons (or none at all), and weak armor, at best. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Animation showing how to punch trees to get wood. (Click to see) \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Play-by-play \n [ edit ] Starting the game \n When you begin the game, you will be standing in a landscape somewhere. Take a moment to look around. This is your "spawn point", where you will reappear if you get killed. It\'s a good idea to mark it immediately, by punching out an X of dirt and/or sand, then using the dirt or sand to build a pillar in the middle of that. If you\'re standing on rock, look around for some dirt or sand to use, remember where you are, and go get it to build your pillar. Before you move,you may want to hit F3 to show the debug info, then hit Esc to pause the game, and write down the coordinates where you started. Also notice what biome you\'re in. Then go back to the game and hit F3 again to get rid of the debug info until you need it again, as it\'s distracting and in the way. \n This assumes you are playing single-player -- if you are entering a multi-player game, you will not be able to change blocks near the spawn point, and will have to move some distance away before you can start gathering resources. But for any number of reasons, you really should try a single-player world for your first game.... \n [ edit ] Tough and Easy Starts \n \n If you are standing on and surrounded by sand, you are likely in a Desert biome. After marking your spawn point, head for high ground and look around for green ground and/or trees ( Cactus and sugar cane don\'t count). Head that way to gather your wood. If you can\'t see anything but desert, pick a random direction and head that way, occasionally going to high ground for a look around. \n If you are on an island, completely surrounded by water as far as you can see, you are in an Ocean biome. This is a very tough start, but if you don\'t want to just delete the world and start over, you can just start swimming until you reach land (hold down space to keep yourself afloat), then continue. \n In either case, "looking around" is a good time to increase your render distance to Far. \n If, looking around, you see purple land and/or giant mushrooms, your game just got a lot easier: That Mushroom Biome will not spawn monsters. Monsters can still come in from other biomes, but if you head toward the middle, you can spend the night in safety outdoors. Also, with a wooden bowl , you can get free food from the Mooshrooms which live there. However, one thing the Mushroom biome does not have, is wood -- so before you go there, head for green territory to get some wood and stone first. \n If, looking around, you see houses and/or farms, you are near an NPC Village . Unfortunately, that\'s not actually a good place to spend the night -- they do have houses that shelter against nighttime mobs, but they also have zombie sieges , where zombies can appear inside the houses. In fact, the villagers are likely to get wiped out before you have a chance to properly trade with them, but the destroyed village will still have a lot of resources for you, usually including farms that will immediately solve your food worries. \n If sheep are not to be found anywhere nearby, then a bed will not be available for a while, so see the note above about putting your shelter away from the spawn area. \n When you are looking around and if you see a swamp style area you are in a swamp biome. This is a potentially good but yet bad start. You will be surrounded by an island that has a sage green grass and trees with vines and ponds randomly scattered around the island. It is an easy way to obtain wood and normally animal mobs spawn as-well so that\'s useful but the downsides are you are most likely near slimes and witch huts.You are relatively far away from another biome but once you settled you can explore via boat. \n If you find yourself surrounded by very many large trees, and leaf blocks on the ground, then you have found yourself in a Jungle Biome. the jungle biome is a good place to start because there are large trees everywhere, however, these can cause you to easily become lost. Jungle Biomes are also the only place to find Ocelots and Cocoa beans. Warning: if you have a slow computer, the graphics in the Jungle Biome may cause your game to crash. \n There are many other biomes in minecraft, and to see a more in depth look at all of them, click here . \n \n [ edit ] First things first \n Look around for a few things in particular, in order of priority: trees, visible stone (and especially coal ore ), animals, and tall grass. As you move around, break any tall grass in your way, and collect any seeds that drop. For that matter, collect any loose item you see, as most of them will eventually be handy. Your first priority is to find a small tree, bash through the leaves if needed, and punch the wood until each block drops as an item. Don\'t bother with huge trees at this point, but also don\'t be upset if you can\'t reach the top blocks of wood -- you can always come back and collect them later. This first tree should give you at least 4 blocks of wood ("logs"). You\'ll punch more wood in a moment, but it\'s probably best to make a couple of tools first. \n [ edit ] Your first crafting \n As the game\'s name suggests, crafting is core to Minecraft. While there is a small number of items that can be crafted directly from the inventory , a Crafting table is required to craft tools and most other items in the game. Naturally, the crafting table can be crafted from the inventory! \n To make your crafting table, first open the inventory (Default E ) and click on a stack of wood logs once collected from a tree : \n    Then place some of the wood in the 2x2 crafting square above your inventory. This will produce planks : \n    The planks will be different colors depending on what sort of wood you have. Different types of wood don\'t stack together, but all work the same. With a couple of exceptions ( slabs , stairs ) you can mix and match different planks when crafting. In particular, sticks don\'t \'care what sort of wood they came from, they all stack together. \n Left clicking on the plank icon will craft four planks for each click, using up one log. (If you hold down shift and click left mouse button it will convert all the wood you put there into planks.) At this point, you want to convert at least 3 logs into planks, and you can do more if you want. If you want to save some logs, click on the remaining wood in your 2x2 crafting square and return it to your inventory. Click on the planks you just crafted and instead of left clicking, right click once in each of your four crafting squares. (This drops one item, instead of all items, each click.) Return the remainder to your inventory. Another option (as of 1.5 ) is to get 4 planks, click &amp; hold on a square in the crafting grid, and drag it around the grid 4 squares are filled. \n You should see this: \n \n \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n \n \n \n Click on the result and place it in an empty square of your hotbar. \n Press ESC or E to return to the world view and walk to a spot you think appropriate, select your newly crafted crafting table with either the mouse wheel or number key( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 , not the keypad), point at a flat square of ground (not directly where you are standing) and right click. This will place your crafting table on the ground ready for use. If you wish to pick it up again to move it, left click and hold to mine it and then walk near the produced icon to pick it up. \n [ edit ] A word about crafting squares \n Whatever you craft on a 2*2 crafting square, such as the one in the inventory, you can also craft in a 3*3 crafting square, like the crafting table. There is no need to open up your inventory to craft a 2*2 recipe if you have a crafting table open. Simply chose any of the four smaller, 2*2 squares that you can infer on the big crafting table. \n [ edit ] Your first tool(s) \n In order to collect stone and coal , the next staple resources, you will need a pickaxe . Your first pickaxe will be made of wood; not very durable or fast, but until you collect some stone, which is why you need a pickaxe in the first place, it\'s all you have. \n You will need at least five planks to make one wooden pickaxe. Use your crafting table by right clicking on where you placed it. Your crafting table view is similar to your inventory view, except you now have a more useful 3x3 crafting space. First we need to make a handle for your pickaxe. To do this, pick up a stack of planks and place one above another anywhere in your crafting square. Two planks produces four sticks : \n \n \n   \n    \n \n   4  \n \n \n   \n    \n \n \n \n To create your pickaxe, you\'ll use some of the planks and sticks you\'ve just made. Arrange them in positions shown on the picture below. \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n You may have noticed that in order to craft a pickaxe, you more or less draw it with its components in your crafting square. Other items are crafted in a similar fashion. At this point, you could go on to create a wooden axe , but you\'re better off going straight for stone.... \n [ edit ] The next level \n Once you\'ve crafted a pickaxe , you can successfully acquire cobblestone to make better tools. Start by finding stone in the world; it should be fairly easy, as it\'s extremely common. If you don\'t see any on the surface, dig down in a staircase fashion - it is highly recommended not to dig straight down. Whack at the stone with your pickaxe; it will drop as cobblestone items. Mine at least 19 blocks of this and approach your crafting table. 19 blocks of stone lets you make a stone sword, a pickaxe, an axe, a shovel, a hoe, and a furnace, letting you complete the tool set. (If you\'re running a couple of blocks short, you can skip the hoe, since that won\'t be useful until you start farming.) \n Using sticks and cobblestone, you can now make some stone tools: \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n Swords can be used to more effectively slay mobs (animals and monsters). \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n A stone pickaxe is more durable and more efficient than a wooden pickaxe. You will use it to mine stone (and other "rocky" blocks). \n \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n Shovels are mainly used to break dirt , grass , sand , clay , and gravel blocks quicker than by hand. \n \n \n \n    \n    \n   \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n   \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n Axes make the process of gathering wood (and most other wooden blocks) much faster. \n [ edit ] More resources \n Now, you should gather more wood, using your new stone axe. Don\'t turn it all into planks up front -- you may need a few logs for charcoal (see below). Although some trees (and their wood) look different than others, all wood functions the same. However, different kinds of wood don\'t stack together, which can take up extra inventory space. You might notice also that the tree\'s leaf blocks slowly disappear, or decay after you cut down all the wood. When the leaves decay when all wood blocks are destroyed, they can drop a sapling , or rarely an apple . Later on, you can use saplings to grow more trees, but just save them for now. For now, harvest a decent amount of wood (perhaps 16 blocks or so, but mind the sun). While you\'re at it, you should also dig (with the shovel) 16 or so blocks of dirt, in case you need to make a pillar or a quick wall when night comes. \n If the sun is still in the sky, explore immediate vicinity for some stone with black specks in it. This is coal , another essential item in Minecraft which can be used to create torches and more. If you cannot find some, don\'t worry: you can make charcoal from wood blocks in a furnace . Charcoal has the same properties as coal. \n You aren\'t too much in need of iron right now, but if you do find any iron ore (looks like stone with tan specks), go for it (you do need the stone pickaxe first). Don\'t be greedy -- if it\'s over a large cave or ravine, much less next to lava, leave it for later. \n [ edit ] Animals \n If you see animals around, you can use your new sword to kill a few of them. Chickens , Pig , and Cows (or Mooshrooms ) all drop meat, which you can cook later, while sheep drop wool , which you can use to make a bed and skip the night altogether. (Later you will be able to make shears , to get wool from sheep without killing them.) Ocelots and Wolves are tamable animals, but wolves will attack you if they are hit. Don\'t slaughter too many critters (they don\'t come back quickly), but try to get 3 pieces of meat, and (if there are sheep) 3 pieces of wool. If you do get the wool, immediately pull out your crafting table, and craft a bed : \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n The type of wood or color of wool doesn\'t matter (and won\'t change the appearance of the bed). \n [ edit ] Heat before light \n Initially, your sole light source in caves and at night will be torches . These are made from coal and sticks. If you haven\'t found coal, you will need to make charcoal instead. Either way, you will also want to cook your meat before you get hungry. \n To do this you need a furnace . To create a furnace , arrange eight cobblestone blocks in a ring on your crafting table. \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n Place your furnace somewhere (say, next to the crafting table) so you can work with it. As it is made with stone, you will have to use your pickaxe to collect it. If you have coal, you can skip making charcoal, and go straight to cooking your meat, but that uses the same system. \n To make charcoal, you have to smelt blocks (logs) of wood. right-click on it and add a fuel in the bottom slot and the wood in the top slot. At this point your fuel of choice is probably wooden planks , two of which will smelt 3 items (logs, meat, ore, etc ). When you place both fuel and something smeltable in the furnace, fire will appear and smelting will start immediately. You don\'t need to wait for it to finish, you can hit Esc to exit the furnace window and do something else while smelting continues. When the furnace\'s fire dies down, right-click it again to retrieve the results. \n Once you have your first pieces of charcoal, switch to using that as fuel -- each piece will smelt 8 items (just like mined coal), and you have other uses for planks. \n \n \n \n   10  \n \n   5  \n \n \n \n \n \n   5  \n \n \n Make about 6 pieces of charcoal. Each piece of charcoal (and coal, they are equal) can smelt 8 blocks, so it pays off more to use them, rather than wooden planks as a fuel. \n Now you can cook your food and make torches. Ration out a piece of coal/charcoal for the food, and cook the food just like smelting the wood above: food in the upper input box, fuel (coal) in the lower one. \n and turn the rest (plus some wood) into torches . \n \n \n   \n    \n \n   4  \n \n \n   \n    \n \n \n \n Now you\'re prepared to light up your shelter. \n [ edit ] Bed and shelter \n If you have made a bed , nightfall is easy: As soon as sunset begins, place your bed, sleep in it by right-clicking on it, and continue with crafting and smelting the next day. (Hint: Music plays at dawn, noon, sunset, and midnight  [Which?] .) It\'s probably good to set up a shelter anyway, but if you run out of time, you can sleep anywhere, as long as there aren\'t already monsters near you. However, the other thing a bed does, is to set your spawn point (where you reappear when you die), but that part only works if you leave the bed there . So for the first night, you might just use the bed and then take it with you, but eventually you will want a safe shelter where you can sleep in your bed and leave it there permanently. \n If you have no bed, and you didn\'t have time to build something secure, you will probably have to spend your first night in an emergency shelter. For some of these options, you can make torches and cook food overnight, but for the underground options, you really want to have some torches handy before you close yourself into the darkness. \n Here are some options for quick shelters: \n [ edit ] Getting above it all \n Build a tall 1x1 column under you, by pillar jumping : look straight down, jump up, and place one of your blocks in the space you\'ve jumped up from. By doing this repeatedly, you can get high enough above the ground that the mobs will be unable to detect you. 10 or 12 blocks will usually be enough, but 16 or 18 is more certain. You will then need to wait until morning. You can also use "crouching" (holding \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift ) to lean over the edge of your pillar and place an extra block or two as a ledge. Then you can put your crafting table (and soon, your furnace) on the ledge and work overnight. (Remember to retrieve them before you come down.) \n Once it is light enough, and the undead have burned, simply dig out the blocks you\'re perched upon, until you\'re back on the ground. (Check for nearby creepers first!) Don\'t just jump off your tower - if you\'re high enough to avoid mob detection then you\'re high enough to take damage if you jump, or even die if you\'re 22 blocks or more up. Also keep an eye out for spiders, which can meet you halfway and knock you off the tower. \n You can make the pillar out of dirt, wood planks (remember, 4 planks to a log), or even cobblestone, but avoid using sand or gravel to make your tower (see below). \n Watch out for climbing Spiders or even (unlikely) a Spider Jockey . To fend off spiders, you can break one of the blocks below your top block, or build a lip around the block you\'re standing on. You do either of these by holding \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift , sneaking far enough over the edge to see the sides of the blocks so you can break one or place blocks on their sides. You will not fall unless you let go of \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift while leaning over the edge... or unless you are attacked. If there are mobs nearby, then it\'s not worth the risk to do this, just be prepared for the spiders, with your stone sword in hand. (Attacking them will knock them down, and they will also take damage from the fall.) \n The reason not to use sand or gravel, is because unlike most blocks, they are affected by gravity: You won\'t be able to place a ledge with them (it will fall to the ground). Also, if a creeper does notice you, and blows up at the bottom of your pillar, the rest of sand you\'re standing on will fall closer to the ground, taking you with it... and apparently, you were already low enough for monsters to notice you. \n If you are in a desert with only sand and cacti all around, and have no other blocks available, don\'t try to use cacti (they\'ll kill you). If you have time, try to gather a lot of sand. If you got at least 40 or 50 by nightfall, you can make enough sandstone for a pillar: Press E for your inventory and crafting window, divide the sand among all four boxes of your crafting grid, and take the result. Sandstone isn\'t very strong, but isn\'t affected by gravity either. Unfortunately, you need 4 sand to get each block of sandstone. If you could only get 15 or 20 blocks, you can make a sand pillar and hope it\'s tall enough. \n  \n [ edit ] Three block high hut \n By making four three block high walls around you, you can simply hide from most mobs. You can make this out of almost anything -- cobblestone is more secure, you can use wood planks if you have enough, but even dirt will do in a pinch. You\'ll need at least a dozen blocks for a bare minimum, but two or three times that, or even a whole stack of 64, will let you build something you can actually move around in, and do some crafting and smelting overnight (Keep a block or few in your inventory as spares). You will have two main risks: One is Spiders , which can both sense you through the walls, and climb the walls. However, they can\'t fit through small holes, and if you make a roof with only a one-block hole, spiders can\'t get through (but you can still tell when day returns). The other hazard is if an Enderman wanders by and takes a block out of your shelter. Wait for the Enderman to wander away a bit, then replace the block, with one of your spares, if possible without letting your cursor cross the Enderman ("looking at them"). When full daylight comes, mine a door in your wall, and exit. \n [ edit ] Out to sea \n If you are near an ocean, you can make a boat and sail out to where you can barely see land (in any direction). If you can\'t make a boat, you can just swim out, holding the space bar all night to keep yourself afloat. Either way, you won\'t be getting any crafting or smelting done. \n [ edit ] Up a tree \n Find a large single tree; and use dirt to pillar up to the top and stay up there till day arrives. Mobs will not spot you if it is a large enough tree and if they do, just take evasive action and move to the other side of the tree. Spiders could give you a problem, but hopefully, they won\'t see you. If the leaf canopy is big enough, you can actually dig up into the leaves, where monsters can\'t reach you. When night\'s over, you can chop down the tree. Take care not to chop it down before you are done using it as a shelter, or the leaves may start to disappear, leaving you with nowhere to stand. \n [ edit ] Hole in the wall \n Dig a hole in the side of a cliff or hill. Make it at least 3 blocks deep. Then go inside the hole. You can keep digging as far as you can, if you want, but try to get at least 7 or 8 blocks in from the entrance (to hide from creepers ) But when you see the sun start to set, fill in your entrance. If it is at least 3 blocks high and you are a good distance off the ground (8+ blocks) then you can leave a one-block window. Otherwise, it is safer to wait until night is over (you can wait 8 minutes clock time). If you don\'t have a window, mine one of your blocks every now and then, and check if it is still night. If it is, fill it back in and repeat. quickly, and don\'t try digging too deep yet. If it is daytime, then congratulations: You have survived your first night. To pass time, you could try extend your makeshift shelter, but be ready to seal up holes if you break through into a cave or out to the night. Also, avoid too much jumping, which spends your hunger quickly. \n [ edit ] In a cave \n If you found a cave system you can fix it up into a lair -- a good one can make a base for the rest of your game. If it ends quickly, then cap off your entrance. If it does not end, then build a little shelter around you [usually by capping off any extra exits or openings into the depths. Don\'t worry too much about the natural walls of the cave, zombies can still be heard through the walls pretty loudly, which can give you a hint where not to dig. \n To block the cave off, for your first night you can use walls of dirt or cobblestone similarly to the "hole in the wall". If you have enough wood, you may be able to craft fences and a fence gate and place them across the entrance. Make sure you place the walls or fences behind the upper lip of the cave (or extend the ceiling over the barrier), or monsters are liable to "drop in" inside your barrier. Likewise, remove any stray blocks, within two spaces outside the fence, from which monster could jump onto the fence (try the jump yourself). If using fences, also make sure you can retreat into the cave and away from the entrance (out of sight or 16 blocks away), or a creeper may drop by and just wait for you to come out. Later, you can be more sophisticated about sealing off and fortifying your lair. \n As with "Hole in the wall", you can dig into the cave\'s wall while waiting for dawn, but keep some blocks handy to patch up any openings you might make into another cave while digging, which might have a hostile mob in it. If you place your pickaxe in the quickslot bar (used to navigate quickly between items you are carrying in your inventory) and e.g. dirt is placed right next to it, you can quickly switch between your tool and that block type in order to close the hole you just made. This can be extremely handy when you stumble upon an opening which contains mobs. \n [ edit ] Break The Golden Rule \n Remember the golden rule we talked about before? Well, when you\'re desperate, you can break it a little. Dig three blocks down, and put a block above you that is not sand/gravel. Congrats, you just made the fastest shelter in Minecraft possible. Since you probably don\'t have a Minecraft clock yet, you may want to use a real-world clock to time the night (7 minutes, with up to 3 more to allow for dawn/dusk). If you have dirt or stone next to you, you can dig out a couple of blocks there, and place your crafting table and furnace. A torch will make your little hideyhole feel a little less like a tomb.... \n [ edit ] Changing The Rules \n If you\'re desperate, you can press the Escape key to pause the game, go into the Options menu, and turn on peaceful mode. Though many players consider it cheating, it\'s a sure-fire way to make sure mobs don\'t spawn. \n [ edit ] Dawn \n Wait for full light, wield your sword, and carefully emerge from your shelter. Hopefully, it will be sunny, but even so, watch out for any remaining monsters -- this may well be your first fight. If you see spiders, don\'t panic, they will hopefully have become peaceful in the sun (or you can try to kill them for their string ). If you see a creeper, your best bet at this point is to run at least 16 blocks away from it, and wait for it to go away (or explode, if it got too close before you got away). If you see any skeletons or zombies (hiding under trees or in water), retreat -- if close enough, they will follow you out from shade or water, and then burn. Tip: Skeletons will seek shade when burning, so they can attack you using their bow and arrow but will not get burnt. WARNING: If a burning skeleton/zombie touches you, you will be set on fire! . Once you\'re out and clear of monsters, look around for and collect bones , arrows , or rotten flesh which may have been dropped by burning skeletons and zombies. \n If it is not sunny, you may have worse problems: You may need to kill zombies or even skeletons (or just retreat back in your shelter until the sun comes out). Zombies are traditionally easy, but in version 1.5 have gotten rather more aggressive, and as of version 1.6 they can spawn other zombies when in danger; skeletons are tougher, and have been made even more so in 1.5. \n Assuming you made it out of the shelter, congratulations! You\'ve survived your first night in Minecraft! Within a day or two, you should have acquired some iron armor and better weapons, which will take a lot of the terror out of nighttime. You can also make a more secure shelter, and hopefully a bed. \n [ edit ] Animal Resources \n If you haven\'t already, you should gather 3 pieces of wool to craft a bed. (Any more is redundant right now.) You can get wool from killing sheep . In most biomes, you will find sheep wandering around as you explore. (Later, you can make shears to get wool repeatedly from the same sheep, as they can grow their wool back). If you can\'t find any sheep around you, but you have a sword (preferably stone or better), you can wait until nightfall and kill some spiders. They usually drop strings, which can be used to make wool in the crafting grid by putting four of them in a square. \n You will probably encounter other animals, such as cows, pigs and chickens. Kill a couple of these with your sword to get a bit of food (if killed by fire a cooked version of their food is dropped). However, don\'t kill too many animals yet, as they don\'t replenish themselves. Also, you might use up your sword\'s durability, which can leave you with no weapons at night! You can eat the meat raw if you\'re starving, but otherwise save it to cook later as cooked food is better than raw. Cooking offers several times better food bar replenishment, and also prevents raw chicken from making you sick (poisoned). You can cook it while building your house, in your furnace . Cows also drop leather . which can be crafted into leather armor , books and Item Frames . Chickens sometimes drop feathers as well as meat - keep the feathers, you\'ll want them later to make arrows . Collect and stash any eggs you find -- you can\'t eat or cook them, but later you can use them to start off a possible chicken farm. \n Note: In recent versions animals rarely spawn during the game, so it\'s quite easy to "hunt out" your area. Once you\'ve gotten your feet under you, you\'ll want to make some fences and fence gates , and capture two of each kind to breed. NOTE: Do not worry about animal genders, there are no different genders in Minecraft and any two animals of a type can breed. \n [ edit ] A Word About Digging \n The golden rule of Minecraft is: \n \n Never dig straight down or up. [1] \n \n It is possible to stand on a block while destroying it. Once it\'s destroyed you will fall down one block to whatever is beneath it. The problem is, there is a significant chance you will either stumble upon a cavern and take fall damage or more unfortunately, fall into lava . If you do land in lava move to water immediately, if any is available, to save your life. (Even if you can\'t save your life, try to get away from the lava before you die, so it won\'t destroy your possessions.) If you survive falling into a cavern, you will then have to mine your way back to the surface. If you dig straight up, then you can dig out a block holding back lava or sand/gravel and also die. Even water could kill you if you aren\'t able to get away quick enough. \n Note - if something is taking a long time to break, stop hitting it unless you just want to remove it; it will disappear when you finally break it - return to it after you have the right tool to retrieve the item. 4 important rules to note are: \n \n The better the material a tool is made of, the faster the tool retrieves and breaks items \n Wood -related items requires no tools to break and obtain the resource, but axes may be used to speed up the process. \n Coal and stone can be mined with a wooden pickaxe, but iron and lapis lazuli require a stone pickaxe, and all other ores require iron tools or better. \n Obsidian , however can only be mined by a diamond pickaxe. \n \n While venturing out in the middle of night is an option, try to avoid it as much as you can. If you do not have enough wool to make a bed you may have to do so, but take extreme care. Wool can come from two sources: Sheep drop wool when killed; once you have a little iron for shears you\'ll be able to get the wool without killing them. If sheep are not to be found, it is also possible to make wool from string , which you can get from killing giant Spiders . You will need 12 pieces of string to make 3 pieces of wool. (You can also get string from cobwebs, but those are only found in underground structures such as Abandoned Mine Shafts which are rather dangerous in their own right.) \n If you have a couple of logs (or 8 planks) left over after making torches and bed, you can also make a chest to stash items you don\'t want to carry around just in case of death: \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n Next item deals with mining. If you\'ve got what you need so far from the surface world, keep on reading. \n [ edit ] Mining \n Players argue about the most optimal way of mining, but one thing is certain: the quickest and most reliable way to gather resources (which is generally what you want, if you don\'t want to stay beginner forever) is cave exploration. \n [ edit ] Finding A Cave \n You have no problems if you have just spent your night in a cave. If you haven\'t, the easiest way to do so is to roam the Overworld a little and look out for exposed cave entrances or if you see an Extreme Hills biome you will most likely find caves on the surface. Sometimes they end immediately, but sometimes they develop into big cave systems. If they seem to end right away sometimes there will be a continuation about 2-8 blocks farther back and below the cave\'s end; mining in these directions (8 blocks back and down, squared [meaning 8 blocks in a row each layer dug]) will reveal this if it is the case. Digging away gravel or dirt can possibly expose other cave extensions, but you may go through a few shovels that way. If you can\'t find any all day, just sleep away the night, replenishing your resources like wood and food as you use them. If you hear suspicious, hostile noises, just try to listen and follow them. \n [ edit ] Cave Exploration \n Cave exploration is pretty straightforward: you light up your way with torches, mine up ores as you see them (check Ores and Minerals) and kill enemies as you encounter them (see Tutorials/Combat for details). There are also some important techniques that might not be obvious to a new player. It also helps to put your torches on either the right or left(always one side only) all the way down so you don\'t get lost. \n [ edit ] Ores and minerals \n There are certain materials that can only be found underground and are crucial to gameplay. \n    Coal is an important material used to make torches and to smelt/cook items. You have to mine it in order not to run out of torches while cave exploring. One stack (64 lumps) will be an ample supply, but in practice, you can start with less and mine more as you go. Long-term, it\'s worth accumulating a stack or few, as once you get seriously into mining, you\'ll be using a lot. Coal is not strictly necessary since you can make charcoal from wood, but it is common, and you have plenty of other things to do with wood. This is the only ore that appears above sea level (anywhere there is stone), and it is often visible in stone outcrops on the surface or even on mountains. \n    Iron is probably the most important and versatile resource you can find underground. You can use it to craft good quality tools , armor and a plethora of other things. Gather as much of it as possible, but it needs a stone pickaxe or better to mine it, so be careful not to use a wooden pick on it. Once you have quite a bit of iron ore , make a base with a furnace to smelt it into iron ingots , that you can then craft. First of all craft a sword and a bucket (fill it with water), then craft iron armor , after that craft an iron pickaxe . This will take a total of 32 ingots, half a stack. If you have extra, optionally make an iron shovel , perhaps some shears , and lastly some spare buckets to hold a second water source or stray lava . Crafting recipes can be found here . \n    Gold , Lapis Lazuli , and Redstone are more specialized ores\xe2\x80\x94gold and redstone need an iron pick, and lapis benefits from one. You don\'t really need them much at the beginning, so you don\'t have to mine them at first. Also, they are only found in deeper parts of the caves. Once you do have a little gold and Redstone , probably the first things you\'ll want to use them for are a compass (iron+redstone), a clock (gold+redstone), and some golden apples (gold+apples). Once you find some sugar cane , you can add a map ( paper +compass) to keep track of your explorations and help avoid getting lost. \n    Diamond is a very rare mineral, probably the most-sought resource in Minecraft. It can be crafted into very durable and quick tools, and vastly superior armor. The ore can be found at the very bottom of the world, the bottom 15 layers of the map, and requires an iron pickaxe to mine. Once you hit bedrock (unbreakable blocks letting off floating gray particles) climb back up about 10 levels and mine around for a while before slowly making your way down one level at a time. At levels 5 and below, you\'ll be working around bedrock, so it\'s better to keep above that -- indeed, it\'s safer to explore at level 11 or above to avoid lava. A good way to check what level you are currently on is to press F3 on your keyboard and read the Y-axis value. Note that the player\'s eyes are 1.62 units above his feet, but as of version 1.3.1, the F3 screen shows both eye and foot heights. \n    Emeralds are normally gained (and used) by trading with villagers, but scattered blocks of the ore can also be found beneath "Extreme Hills" biomes . Emerald ore is found at the same depths as gold ore, and likewise requires an iron pickaxe. It is not used for tools, or much else besides trading. \n [ edit ] Home safety \n \n Main article: Trap \n \n By the end of the first day the shelter will likely be primitive and small, in the days after it\'s easier to build a \'home\', in whatever shape or form you can imagine. Most likely, you will be sleeping outside (if you found sheep) in the first few nights. In the first shelter it\'s likely you only have 1 entrance, therefore it may be wise to add a crude \'defense\' or trap to stop monsters from \'grouping up\' at the door. For example, when you do not use a bed to skip the night and get disturbed while you are building, it would be best to have an alternative to fighting off the mobs. A simple and effective defense is to dig a small 3 block deep trench on both sides next to the door. The monster will have a hard time not falling down when it\'s following you to the shelter. However, due to the improved AI of hostile mobs, it is less likely for them to fall into trenches and other dangerous traps. Note: you can surround the top blocks with signs, mobs will think the sign is a block and will attempt to stand on top of it, causing them to fall into the pit. Ladders do this as well. Just be careful to avoid your own traps when you walk out the front door. \n \n \n \n  \nA 3x3x2 chamber in stone, filled with 1 bed, 1 furnace, 1 crafting table and 1 torch. Sealed with door and defended by dry moat. \n \n \n [ edit ] Next day \n A tutorial for your next day is available here: the Second Day . \n [ edit ] Important things to remember \n \n Do not dig straight up or down. \n Do not have a Flint &amp; Steel equipped when operating equipment (E.g. doors, switches etc.) \n Do not have TNT equipped near any item that can emit a redstone signal (E.g. Switches, Redstone torches etc.) \n Always use the \xe2\x87\xa7 Left Shift key when working near dangerous areas (E.g. Long Drops, Lava, etc.) \n \n [ edit ] The shopping list \n This is a quick reference for what you will need to survive your first night. \n \n Bearings \n \n \n Mark spawn. \n \n \n Gather and craft [amounts are close to minimal, and are barring any additions or extras] \n \n \n Get 10 or more logs: See note below \n Get 3 wool blocks \n Make a crafting table \n Make a wooden pickaxe \n Get 11 cobblestone * \n Make a stone pickaxe \n Make an Iron Pickaxe, and shears after that (If you hit Iron) \n Get about 4 saplings (these are found when you chop down a tree) \n \n \n Shelter \n \n \n Make a bed \n Start on shelter (materials depend, not counted) \n Create a front door for your shelter and include a back door as well if at all possible (back door not included in above material count). \n Create a storage chest and place it in the shelter \n Create a furnace \n If you didn\'t find coal, smelt a few logs to make charcoal. Smelting 3 logs with 2 planks for fuel (also not included in the material count) will be most efficient . \n Create some torches and place them \n \n \n Planting \n \n \n Plant four saplings (they will grow into trees), so you won\'t have to go exploring and get lost. \n \n \n Resource usage \n \n 9 logs equal 32 planks and a leftover log (logs do not have much use, so you might as well make 36 planks as long as you already have torches.) \n \n 4 planks for crafting table \n 4 planks for sticks for pickaxes and some torches \n 3 planks for head of pickaxe \n 8 planks for storage chest \n 6 planks for door \n 3 planks for bed \n 1 log + 1 plank for furnace (plank as fuel, log for charcoal) \n \n \n Multiplayer \n \n \n a few Wooden Pressure Plates. You never know when they may come in handy, perhaps saving you from a devious Iron Door trap! \n \n * Tip: Gather 3 cobblestone first, then make a stone pickaxe; use it to gather 8 cobblestone for a furnace. \n [ edit ] Tutorial videos \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n Most efficient First day tutorial 1.6.2 (tnthost) \n The First Day in Minecraft 1.0.0 (SecretRevelation) \n The First Day (Beginners\'

The health and hunger bars, as well as the hotbar, are visible. \n \n \n  This article is about the game mode. For other uses, see Survival (disambiguation) . \n Survival mode is the game mode of Minecraft in which players must collect resources, build structures, battle mobs , maintain hunger , and explore the land in an effort to survive. \n In Survival, players have an inventory in which they may gather items . These items may be combined using certain recipes to create tools and other items. This process is known as crafting . Most crafting recipes need a crafting table . Players are also able to create potions by brewing . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Survival single player (SSP) \n \n 1.1 Aim of the game \n \n \n 2 Survival multiplayer (SMP) \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Bugs \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ]  Survival single player (SSP) \n Survival single player is the original game mode of Minecraft . Until mid-Alpha, SSP was the only available mode besides Classic creative mode. SSP may be played online or offline, as long as the user has initially played it while connected to the Internet (which allows game files to download to their computer). \n [ edit ] Aim of the game \n Despite being marketed as a game with no pre-determined goals, Minecraft does offer a proper ending when played in Survival mode by defeating the Ender Dragon . However when you reach The Nether the player has the option of: 1. Finding a Nether Fortress and using Wither Skeleton heads to create a Wither , or 2. Making Eyes of Ender and using these to go to The End to defeat the Ender Dragon. Choosing to attempt the Wither boss first proves more rewarding as the player can then make beacons and use them to help defeat overworld mobs - usually via grinders. Although one can take a beacon to fight the dragon, it (along with it\'s support blocks) will be frequently destroyed by the passing dragon. \n \n The player starts in The Overworld where they must learn to survive using the player\'s intuition. \n The player must search caves or ravines for specific items to survive their first night. \n The player crafts their first tools which, under most (although not all) circumstances, will be a wooden pickaxe . This is then used to acquire stone tools. \n The player builds a home featuring a bed , chests full of spare materials, a crafting table , and a furnace . \n The player successfully finds a cave, canyon, or large underground opening which contains large deposits of usable minerals. \n The player finds and smelts iron ore into iron ingots and uses it for tools, or, if they acquire enough, possibly (but not necessarily) armor . \n The player strikes diamonds ! While looking for diamonds it is important the player keep a level head as to their surroundings, for in large caves there are usually many enemy mobs that can hunt down the player, so a few swords , a full set of armor and many torches are usually necessary. \n The player mines some obsidian . If not found, obsidian can be created by crafting a bucket , filling it with water , and pouring it into stationary lava . \n The player builds a portal to The Nether with the newly acquired obsidian. \n The player appears in the dimension The Nether; a new world bereft of minerals which poses new, scary threats to the player: Zombie Pigmen , Magma Cubes , Ghasts , Blazes , and Wither Skeletons . \n The player finds a Nether Fortress and finds the blaze spawner and attacks the Blazes, killing them and collecting their Blaze Rods from their defeat for use in potion brewing and to access the last challenge. \n The player navigates safely and successfully through The Nether and returns to The Overworld where their job is to find Endermen and kill them to obtain their Ender Pearls . \n The player constructs a peculiar item with unusual ghostly properties called an Eye of Ender , which when thrown will direct the player to the Stronghold they must go and find. \n Twelve Eyes of Ender must be kept with you when you find the Stronghold . This is important. \n Once the player finds the portal and the player has put the 12 Eyes of Ender in place, the portal into The End will open and you will now meet your destiny. \n Once their most worthy adversary, the legendary Ender Dragon , has been beaten, a story will scroll and credits will roll and then, and only then, the player will be teleported to their spawn location. (You can press ESC if you want to skip the story and credits, but read the story.) \n After you beat the game, you can explore the world, make a mineshaft underground, enlarge your house, defeat enemy mobs, and eat porkchops to your ever-growing imagination in the world of Minecraft . \n An optional thing to do is to kill the Wither to make a beacon so you can have some perks in a distance. \n \n [ edit ]  Survival multiplayer (SMP) \n \n See also: Multiplayer \n \n Survival multiplayer is played by users who connect to a central Minecraft server . This enables them to interact with other users. \n The command to toggle a player\'s game mode (survival, adventure or creative) in multiplayer (must be operator in order to use this command) is: \n \n/gamemode [0/1/2] [player\'s name]\n \n (0 for survival, 1 for creative, 2 for adventure) \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n This game mode was introduced on 4 th of August, 2009 in Survival Test under Classic . During this time, players experienced permadeath, meaning they could not respawn and the level needed to be restarted unless a save file had been created. \n The inventory and crafting was only introduced in the Indev version while the Infdev version features infinite map generation. This version also drops the permadeath feature allowing the player to respawn . The Alpha version improved the map generation by introducing biomes . \n The Multiplayer variant of this game mode also took place in the Alpha version. Originally, Notch had only allowed a limited number of people from the Minecraft IRC channel to participate in the first tests of SMP. These invitees could invite other people to test out this mode; however the password was leaked and the server was quickly filled up. Notch released the first version of the SMP server software on the 4th of August, 2010. The client was updated so that players could enter the IP of a server to join it. \n As of version 1.3, SSP was abolished in a technical sense. Instead, the player hosts a server that they can either close or open to others at any time. This change was intended to reduce the labor required to fix bugs for two different parts of Minecraft, at a slight performance cost. \n [ edit ] Bugs \n \n Main article: Known bugs \n \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Survival&amp;oldid=499230 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Gameplay Game modes  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 30 June 2013, at 06:40. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

For other uses, see Survival (disambiguation) . \n Survival mode is the game mode of Minecraft in which players must collect resources, build structures, battle mobs , maintain hunger , and explore the land in an effort to survive. \n In Survival, players have an inventory in which they may gather items . These items may be combined using certain recipes to create tools and other items. This process is known as crafting . Most crafting recipes need a crafting table . Players are also able to create potions by brewing . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Survival single player (SSP) \n \n 1.1 Aim of the game \n \n \n 2 Survival multiplayer (SMP) \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Bugs \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ]  Survival single player (SSP) \n Survival single player is the original game mode of Minecraft . Until mid-Alpha, SSP was the only available mode besides Classic creative mode. SSP may be played online or offline, as long as the user has initially played it while connected to the Internet (which allows game files to download to their computer). \n [ edit ] Aim of the game \n Despite being marketed as a game with no pre-determined goals, Minecraft does offer a proper ending when played in Survival mode by defeating the Ender Dragon . However when you reach The Nether the player has the option of: 1. Finding a Nether Fortress and using Wither Skeleton heads to create a Wither , or 2. Making Eyes of Ender and using these to go to The End to defeat the Ender Dragon. Choosing to attempt the Wither boss first proves more rewarding as the player can then make beacons and use them to help defeat overworld mobs - usually via grinders. Although one can take a beacon to fight the dragon, it (along with it\'s support blocks) will be frequently destroyed by the passing dragon. \n \n The player starts in The Overworld where they must learn to survive using the player\'s intuition. \n The player must search caves or ravines for specific items to survive their first night. \n The player crafts their first tools which, under most (although not all) circumstances, will be a wooden pickaxe . This is then used to acquire stone tools. \n The player builds a home featuring a bed , chests full of spare materials, a crafting table , and a furnace . \n The player successfully finds a cave, canyon, or large underground opening which contains large deposits of usable minerals. \n The player finds and smelts iron ore into iron ingots and uses it for tools, or, if they acquire enough, possibly (but not necessarily) armor . \n The player strikes diamonds ! While looking for diamonds it is important the player keep a level head as to their surroundings, for in large caves there are usually many enemy mobs that can hunt down the player, so a few swords , a full set of armor and many torches are usually necessary. \n The player mines some obsidian . If not found, obsidian can be created by crafting a bucket , filling it with water , and pouring it into stationary lava . \n The player builds a portal to The Nether with the newly acquired obsidian. \n The player appears in the dimension The Nether; a new world bereft of minerals which poses new, scary threats to the player: Zombie Pigmen , Magma Cubes , Ghasts , Blazes , and Wither Skeletons . \n The player finds a Nether Fortress and finds the blaze spawner and attacks the Blazes, killing them and collecting their Blaze Rods from their defeat for use in potion brewing and to access the last challenge. \n The player navigates safely and successfully through The Nether and returns to The Overworld where their job is to find Endermen and kill them to obtain their Ender Pearls . \n The player constructs a peculiar item with unusual ghostly properties called an Eye of Ender , which when thrown will direct the player to the Stronghold they must go and find. \n Twelve Eyes of Ender must be kept with you when you find the Stronghold . This is important. \n Once the player finds the portal and the player has put the 12 Eyes of Ender in place, the portal into The End will open and you will now meet your destiny. \n Once their most worthy adversary, the legendary Ender Dragon , has been beaten, a story will scroll and credits will roll and then, and only then, the player will be teleported to their spawn location. (You can press ESC if you want to skip the story and credits, but read the story.) \n After you beat the game, you can explore the world, make a mineshaft underground, enlarge your house, defeat enemy mobs, and eat porkchops to your ever-growing imagination in the world of Minecraft . \n An optional thing to do is to kill the Wither to make a beacon so you can have some perks in a distance. \n \n [ edit ]  Survival multiplayer (SMP) \n \n See also: Multiplayer \n \n Survival multiplayer is played by users who connect to a central Minecraft server . This enables them to interact with other users. \n The command to toggle a player\'s game mode (survival, adventure or creative) in multiplayer (must be operator in order to use this command) is: \n \n/gamemode [0/1/2] [player\'s name]\n \n (0 for survival, 1 for creative, 2 for adventure) \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n This game mode was introduced on 4 th of August, 2009 in Survival Test under Classic . During this time, players experienced permadeath, meaning they could not respawn and the level needed to be restarted unless a save file had been created. \n The inventory and crafting was only introduced in the Indev version while the Infdev version features infinite map generation. This version also drops the permadeath feature allowing the player to respawn . The Alpha version improved the map generation by introducing biomes . \n The Multiplayer variant of this game mode also took place in the Alpha version. Originally, Notch had only allowed a limited number of people from the Minecraft IRC channel to participate in the first tests of SMP. These invitees could invite other people to test out this mode; however the password was leaked and the server was quickly filled up. Notch released the first version of the SMP server software on the 4th of August, 2010. The client was updated so that players could enter the IP of a server to join it. \n As of version 1.3, SSP was abolished in a technical sense. Instead, the player hosts a server that they can either close or open to others at any time. This change was intended to reduce the labor required to fix bugs for two different parts of Minecraft, at a slight performance cost. \n [ edit ] Bugs \n \n Main article: Known bugs \n \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Survival&amp;oldid=499230 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Gameplay Game modes  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 30 June 2013, at 06:40. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

For instructional material, see Tutorials . \n \n \n \n  \nA sunset in a taiga biome . \n \n \n Gameplay in most game modes of Minecraft consists mainly of adding and destroying a variety of different blocks in a randomly generated world. \n With these blocks, players can manipulate the world around them, building and destroying structures. As gameplay in Minecraft is so open and unguided, players often set their own goals and play the game as they see fit. An example of this is the Minecraft sport, Spleef . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Game modes \n \n 1.1 Survival \n 1.2 Creative \n 1.3 Adventure \n 1.4 Hardcore \n \n \n 2 Table of game modes \n 3 Video \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Game modes \n \n \n Animation showing the different game modes \n \n \n The four game modes in Minecraft are Survival, Creative, Adventure and Hardcore. In the level.dat , Survival mode is gametype=0, Creative is gametype=1 and Adventure is gametype=2. Hardcore is Survival with the addition of hardcore=1 (for Survival and Creative, hardcore=0). This knowledge allows hacking to change game modes by editing the world\'s level.dat. The command "/gamemode" can be used to switch between these. Example: "/gamemode 1" would put you into creative mode. \n [ edit ] Survival \n \n Main article: Survival (game mode) \n \n In this mode, players have to gather all their materials to build, craft and gain experience points. There is a health , hunger and armor bar, an inventory and, when underwater , an oxygen bar . \n [ edit ] Creative \n \n Main article: Creative (game mode) \n \n The player will have access to an infinite amount of almost all blocks and items available, and can destroy them instantly. Players are invulnerable and do not have health, armor, or hunger, and can fly . The player has access to items not available in Survival mode, e.g. spawn eggs . \n [ edit ] Adventure \n \n Main article: Adventure \n \n Players can interact with objects such as levers and buttons , and can interact with mobs . However, they can only break blocks with the correct tools ([dirt broken with the shovel]or[stone broken with the pickaxe]) , making this mode good for adventure maps. Although this game mode has been released, it is still in its early stages, lacking in many features including the ability to toggle the use of tools by players. \n [ edit ] Hardcore \n \n Main article: Hardcore \n \n In this mode, which plays in the same way as Survival mode, the difficulty level is permanently set to "Hard" and the map must be deleted upon the player\'s death. \n Technically, Hardcore is a game mode modifier rather than a game mode. However, without cheating, it is only possible to get "Hardcore Survival". To attain "Hardcore Creative" mode, the player must edit the game world with external tools, or opening to LAN, and enabling cheats. There is almost no visible difference between "Hardcore Creative" and "Non-Hardcore Creative", because in Creative mode the only way to die is to fall into the Void. Because of this, "Hardcore" usually refers to "Hardcore Survival". On a server, if someone dies, they will be banned.

Vanilla multiplayer servers also start at the beginning of daytime, but the cycle ignores new players joining, so the cycle could be at any point when any particular player first spawn into a server. \n Daytime features the Sun and a light blue sky. This color depends on the biome you are currently in. Deserts and Forests have a turquoise sky, while Tundra and Taiga have a more blue sky.\n \n If placed in the Overworld using external editors or superflat codes, the End\'s biome has a black sky all day. The Nether\'s biome, however, has a normal sky when edited into the Overworld. \n \n \n During daytime, all blocks that are in direct vertical view of the sky receive daylight, the strongest light possible, which is light level 15 . \n Daylight provides ample light for the growth of all trees and crops . \n Zombies and Skeletons in direct view of the sky (and not in water) during daytime will be set on fire. Additionally, Spiders in direct view of the sky that are already aggressive will become neutral unless they are currently chasing the player, and Endermen in direct view of the sky will teleport randomly when near the player and become neutral if aggressive. Creepers and Slimes are the only naturally-spawned hostile Overworld mobs that are unaffected by sunlight. \n Daylight Sensors will work. \n \n [ edit ] Sunset/dusk \n \n \n \n  \nExample sunset seen from a high spot on the map. \n \n \n Lasts 1&#160; 1 \xe2\x81\x84 2 minutes. \n \n A period between daytime and nighttime, when the Sun sets on the West horizon, and the Moon rises on the East horizon. \n The light level of all blocks that are in direct vertical view of the sky and are not lit by other sources decreases by 1 every 10 seconds. \n The sky near the setting Sun will have a red glow when the Sun sets. \n Actual time of Sunset will not change if the texture for the Sun is changed. The day/night cycle will be the same length with the same effects even if the Sun is visibly larger or smaller. \n The Sun will also get visibly larger when it sets. \n Between dusk and dawn you may sleep in a bed . In single-player mode, doing so will advance the day-night cycle to dawn. This will also occur in multiplayer if every player online is in a bed simultaneously. Time doesn\'t pass with regards to other aspects of the world, though. Crops won\'t grow, and items in furnaces won\'t cook, for example, although active weather effects usually stop. \n \n [ edit ] Nighttime \n \n \n \n  \nA Tundra biome during the night; various Mobs can be seen. \n \n \n Lasts 7 minutes. \n \n During nighttime the world is covered in darkness with a light level of 4 and hostile mobs will spawn on the surface. \n Nighttime features the Moon and a dark blue sky with white stars. \n The stars at night appear to move with the Moon, and can be seen in the Void at dawn and dusk. \n During the night crops will still grow (unless the player sleeps through night). \n \n [ edit ] Sunrise/dawn \n \n \n \n  \nExample of the Sun rising in the horizon. \n \n \n Lasts 1&#160; 1 \xe2\x81\x84 2 minutes. \n \n A period between nighttime and daytime, when Moon sets on the West horizon and the Sun rises on the East horizon. \n All blocks that are in direct vertical view of the sky get 1 shade of lighting brighter every 10 seconds. \n The sky near the rising Sun will have a red glow when the Sun rises. \n The Sun will slowly shrink to its 8x8 pixel size while rising. \n Skeletons and Zombies will begin to burn. \n Spiders will become neutral. \n \n [ edit ] Clock \n \n Main article: Clock \n \n Clocks allow players to determine Minecraft time. They are useful underground where the current day/night cycle is not visible. They help the player avoid mistakenly surfacing at night and falling prey to night-spawned surface mobs. Clocks will spin uselessly in the Nether and the End as there is no day-night cycle in those dimensions. \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.8pre \n In the leaked 1.8 pre-release version, the player can manipulate the time by pressing F6 to reverse time and F7 to advance time. \n \n \n 1.9pre4 \n Notch mentioned on his Twitter that the Sun actually rose in the north in Minecraft. [3] This was a bug and was fixed in Beta 1.9 prerelease 4, so the Sun and Moon now both rise in the east.; [4] this also changed the South-West rule to the South-East rule . \n \n \n Added lunar phases . [1] [2] \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w21a \n The stars that appear at night were updated to be more realistic (slightly smaller and brighter). \n \n \n 1.5 \n 13w01a \n Daylight sensors determine what time of day it is by outputting a redstone signal. \n \n \n 1.6 \n 13w24a \n Gamerule doDaylightCycle added, turns the day-night cycle on or off. \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Minecraft time is exactly 72 times faster than normal time. This can be easily calculated as the proportion 1440 \xe2\x81\x84 20 = 72, as there are 1440 minutes in a real day (60 \xc3\x97 24) and 20 minutes in a full minecraft day. \n The Sun and Moon rotate around the player, not the center of the map. \n In the Minecraft sky , the Sun and Moon always appear in the same position relative to the stars. \n Day and night do not proceed when a single player game is paused. This also applies when switching to a different window, unless a GUI window (such as the inventory) is open. In multiplayer, time proceeds normally as long as the server is on. \n If the player flies or climbs high enough, the Sun and Moon appear at the same time, apparently because the chunks in the way have unloaded. This has been redefined from a bug to a feature. Even a height of 90 or so (say, the top of an Extreme Hills mountain) will keep both visible well after one of them "should" have set at ground level. \n If Zombies or Skeletons are in water or in the shadows caused by trees , they can survive through the daytime. \n The day-night cycle continues while in the Nether or the End, but the world will not change until the chunks load again. \n Use of a bed or portal can leave nighttime monsters "stranded" in daylight. That is, monsters that were present when you "left" at night, will not despawn merely because it is day when you arrive. (Of course, undead may burn.) The reverse transition (portals only) is slightly less dangerous, as you will have a few moments before the nighttime monsters spawn. \n There cannot be eclipses due to the fact the sun and moon are always on the other side of each other. \n If Spiders emerge from a dark cave during daytime, they will still be hostile, but only for a few seconds. \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n notchtweet:124251105277386752 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/la87q/notch_is_implementing_moon_phases/c2r4hjg \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n notchtweet:88155424880201728 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n notchtweet:124414532847284224 \n \n \n \n Environment [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Environment/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Day-night_cycle&amp;oldid=497161 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Category : Environment  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 24 June 2013, at 09:21. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

Note that this applies to each of the 3 axes including N/S, E/W, and up/down. This fact is significant for preventing hostile mob spawning. If a torch (level 14) is placed on a wall two blocks up from the floor, the light level on the floor one block away from the wall will be 11 (e.g. 14 minus 2 down, minus 1 south). If the torch were placed on the floor at floor level, then the light level on the floor one block away from the wall will be 13 (e.g. 14 minus 0 down, minus 1 south). \n Light decreases diagonally by "taxicab distance", or the sum of the distance along each axis. This means that if a torch (level 14) is placed on the floor, the light level on the adjacent floor blocks in all four direction will be 13 while the diagonal blocks in all four directions will have light level 12 (e.g. 14 minus 1 south, minus 1 east). Along a floor, this effect produces a diamond-shaped pattern of illumination around the light source. Remember, light decrease takes place in three dimensions. This means that if a torch (level 14) is placed on a wall one block up from the floor, then the block on the floor tht is diagonally one block way will have a light level of 11 (e.g. 14 minus 1 south, minus 1 east, minus 1 down). \n The minimum number of light sources needed to prevent hostile mob spawning in the Overworld is difficult to determine because light decreases in all three dimensions. Given a perfectly flat plane or floor, the cheapest and easiest solution is to place torches on the floor in a diamond pattern, with 5 blocks in-between each torch diagonally. \n Here, the yellow "T" represents a torch on the floor, and number is the light level of adjacent floor blocks. Note that no block is less than light level 8, which means that hostile mobs cannot spawn. The green is only to highlight the 5 blocks between each torch. \n However, when outdoors, if the ground level changes by even one block, this decreases light further, requiring a different pattern. Additionally, when indoors it may be more aesthetically pleasing to light sources along walls or attached to the ceiling. But this means that the light level will decrease from ceiling to floor, and the light level of the floor is used to calculate mobs spawning. \n [ edit ] Light-filtering blocks \n \n \n \n  \nHow ice affects light. Click through to see it animated between ice and water. \n \n \n Solid blocks prevent the spread of light, while glass and portal interiors have no effect on light level. \n All other transparent blocks reduce the spread of light. The following values are the amount each block decreases the light value. The light emitted decreases by one for each square of distance from the light source, more depending on the block it passes through. \n \n \n Icon \n Block \n Decrease \n \n \n  \n Farmland \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n \n \n  \n Slab \n \n \n  \n Stairs \n \n \n  \n Ice \n 3 \n \n \n  \n Water \n \n \n  \n Cobweb \n 1 \n \n \n  \n Leaves \n \n \n [ edit ] Smooth lighting \n Smooth lighting (which includes ambient occlusion as well as interpolating lighting across block faces) is the lighting engine added in Beta 1.3 , with the help of MrMessiah. [1] This lighting engine is set on by default, and can be enabled or disabled by accessing Video Options from the Options menu. \n The engine blends lighting to add semi-realistic shadows and glowing from light sources. It darkens inside corners, resulting in small spaces appearing much darker. Before Beta 1.3, the feature could only be obtained by modifying the game with the help of MrMessiah\'s BetterLight mod . \n In 1.5, a "Maximum" smooth lighting toggle was added, which fixes bugs with stairs. However, this is an optional toggle as it decreases performance slightly. The previous smooth lighting was put under a "Minimum" toggle. \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n Minecraft has an extensive history when it comes to lighting. Classic\xe2\x80\x99s lighting model is simple and only checks whether a block is exposed to the sky. Indev\xe2\x80\x99s model is more complex and considers a block\xe2\x80\x99s distance from the nearest sunlight and from the nearest light-emitting block. Alpha\xe2\x80\x99s model is a refinement of Indev\xe2\x80\x99s, calculating sunlight and block-emitted light separately and using a different scale of light intensities. An earlier Beta update improved upon Alpha\'s model by adding the smooth lighting option, and in a later Beta update, the whole lighting engine was again rewritten to be much more efficient, have more detail, and be smooth in transition of lighting differentials. \n [ edit ] Classic \n \n \n \n  \nLight in Classic \n \n \n In Classic , \xe2\x80\x9csunlight\xe2\x80\x9d is emitted by the top edge of the map and will hit any block that is under it. It will pass through transparent blocks to light blocks underneath. Blocks that do not receive light are in a dim shadow that remains at the same level of brightness no matter how far they are from a light source. \n [ edit ] Indev/Infdev \n In Indev and Infdev versions there are 16 degrees of brightness, with a maximum of 15 for full daylight and a minimum of 0 for almost complete darkness. Brightness is a linear scale and represents its value divided by 15, so for example 15 is 100% ( 15 \xe2\x81\x84 15 ) and 13 is 86.67% ( 13 \xe2\x81\x84 15 ). \n Each block that emits light has its own luminance value and the light value diminishes by one level each block from its source. If the neighbouring block already has a greater light value, it is ignored. The process is repeated for each block whose light value just changed. \n During the day, sunlight has a maximum light value of 15 . At dusk, it steadily decreases until it reaches a night-time minimum value of 4 representing moonlight. Sunlight is emitted by the top edge of the map, but does not diminish with distance from its \xe2\x80\x9csource\xe2\x80\x9d. A block lit by sunlight will be equally bright at any height or depth. \n Minecraft - Pocket Edition has just got smooth lighting, with the update 0.7.0. \n [ edit ] Alpha - Beta 1.2_02 \n Lighting in Alpha through pre- Beta 1.3 works as Indev and Infdev, except that the scale is different and is not linear. \n Full daylight provides the maximum brightness of 15 . Each value below this is 80% as bright as the one above it. For example, 14 is 80% as bright as sunlight, and 13 is 64% bright. This means that Level 0 still has 0.8\xc2\xb9\xe2\x81\xb5\xc2\xb7100% = 3.5% of the maximum brightness. \n Sunlight in Alpha has its own light array and a behind-the-scenes optimization to make dawn and dusk smoother: the amount of light from the sky is pre-calculated and saved along with the blocks, because it never needs to change except when blocks are added or removed. During dusk, nighttime, and dawn, a "darkness" value is subtracted from the sky to create the effects of different times of day. \n In the Nether , light decreases by 10% each level, rather than the normal 20%. This means it will never be totally dark in the Nether. The minimum light value is 20.59%, providing a permanent dim ambience equivalent to normal world\'s level 8. \n [ edit ] Beta 1.3 - Beta 1.7.3 \n Lighting from Beta 1.3 to 1.7.3 works the same as how it was in Alpha, but is greater optimized to allow smooth lighting . \n [ edit ] Beta 1.8 - 1.4.7 \n \n \n \n  \nBeta 1.8 pre-release light spectrum during day. The X axis represents exposure to block light sources (e.g.: torches) while the Y axis represents exposure to sunlight \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nBeta 1.8 pre-release light spectrum during night. The Y axis is colored slightly blue and represents the total exposure to moonlight \n \n \n In Beta 1.8, a new lighting engine was implemented. The new engine has added and changed the following: \n \n The lighting of an area is influenced by the type of light source that is lighting the block: moonlight gives a blue tint, torches and lava give a reddish tint, and complete darkness and sunlight are the same as before. \n Changes in lighting are now instant, and can be gradual as changes in the time of day and the state of rainfall now smoothly change the lighting value rather than individually updating the lighting of chunks one by one. \n Using the new instant lighting, non-sunlight lighting now subtly flickers, although this feature is purely cosmetic and has no effect on gameplay. \n Sunset is much more intense and realistic than before, and its intensity dims if the player turns away from it. \n At extreme depths, black fog closes in. At the bedrock level, a torch can no longer be seen from 11 squares distance. This effect is inhibited by proximity to open sky (i.e. the degree to which the place where you are standing would be lit by sunlight), whether or not the sun is currently up. Digging a shaft from the surface down to your room will allow you to see far, even at bedrock level. \n When inside the void , lighting operates similar to Classic, where objects in the void will remain at a constant brightness, regardless of how far they travel away from a light source, provided that they remain directly underneath an opening into the void. The brightness of the particular "column" of space is based on the current light level at level 0, the bottom bedrock layer. This applies to all entities, as well as particles. \n Additionally, sitting in the void underneath a shaft which allows sunlight directly into it will remove the void fog, regardless to whether is it daytime or not. \n \n [ edit ] 1.5 \n As of 1.5, there were several lighting optimizations, including more realistic lighting and lighting interacting correctly with slabs and stairs. However, furnaces emitting light from all sides, and black spots in world generation were not fixed. As well, there are now three different levels of smooth lighting: Off, Minimum, and Maximum. \n [ edit ] Future \n In snapshot 12w39a , Dinnerbone fixed black patches in world generation, [2] and began overhauling the lighting systems such as changing the lighting of blocks to allow for directional lighting. [3] [4] \n World generation issues were temporarily fixed, [5] but Dinnerbone reverted these changes due to performance decreases. [6] [7] \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Fixed lighting on the furnace (front) [3] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n (Back) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Slab lighting fix [8] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Other image \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Hostile mobs can spawn in areas where there should be light, but there isn\'t. This is because the game thinks there is a light level of 0. \n Smooth Lighting is not apparent on the top of water or on paintings . \n A 21 x 21 square of opaque material is enough to spawn mobs in the shadow underneath. \n If Zombies or Skeletons are in water or in the low light levels caused by trees , they can survive through the daytime. \n The Halloween Update version Alpha 1.2.0 allowed monsters to spawn in higher light levels at lower depths, using the formula 16 \xe2\x88\x92 (Layer / 8). At level 8 and below, mobs could spawn even in sunlight. Notch reverted mob spawning to the original method in version Alpha 1.2.1, saying, "it was way too annoying. I have plans on what to do with this." \n In Minecraft\'s source code, the luminescences are defined using the floating point values in the third column. In a weird quirk, these floating point numbers are fractions of 16, but are multiplied by 15 to get the integer light value. This means that both 0/16 and 1/16 (0.0 and 0.0625) correspond to the integer light value 0. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Lighting, the wool block is exposed to sunlight ("Moody" brightness setting). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Lighting, the wool block is exposed to sunlight ("Bright" brightness setting). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Eleven different layers of brightness ("Smooth lighting" setting disabled). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Lighting in the Void.

Generally, mobs are affected by the environment in the same ways as the player \xe2\x80\x94they are subject to physics , they can be hurt by catching on fire (except for Witches and Nether mobs such as Zombie Pigmen , Wither Skeletons , Blazes , and Ghasts ), falling , drowning , or suffocating , and they can even ride minecarts . When mobs are killed, they drop items which may be useful resources. Mobs come to exist by spawning in various ways. Players can spawn most mobs using spawn eggs in Creative mode . Mobs are aware of players within 16 blocks of them, except for Ghasts , which can see up to 100 blocks away, Endermen , who can see up to 64 blocks away, and (in 1.6) Zombies , which can see up to 66 blocks away (just over four times farther than the former 16 blocks). [1] \n The term mob is short for mobile [2] and has been used as a general term referring to any moving entities in games since the first MUDs surfaced. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Current mobs \n \n 1.1 Passive \n \n 1.1.1 Video \n \n \n 1.2 Neutral \n 1.3 Tamable \n 1.4 Hostile \n \n 1.4.1 Video \n \n \n 1.5 Utility \n 1.6 Bosses \n 1.7 Potential future mobs \n \n \n 2 AI \n \n 2.1 Hostile mobs \n 2.2 Passive mobs \n \n \n 3 Achievements \n 4 Notes \n 5 Bugs \n 6 Trivia \n 7 References \n \n \n \n \n Current mobs \n There are 31 mobs, excluding the player. \n \n Passive \n Passive mobs will never attack the player. \nAll passive mobs except squid require land to spawn on.

Below is the list of mobs that have been mentioned at least once by Notch , Jeb , or other Mojang employees who work on Minecraft and have a possibility of appearing in the game. \n \n Aside from zombie pigmen , living pigmen have been confirmed to appear in a future update. However, they are not being currently worked on. [4] \n In the Halloween Update , Notch said he would add fish . [5] However, he had limited time, and was thus only able to add them as an item. There is no coding for fish in the game, and no model was created. Dinnerbone has stated that they have plans for fishing, so it is possible fish mobs will be added to the game. [ citation&#160;needed ] \n Red dragons have been mentioned in multiple posts by Notch. However, he is no longer working on the game. Jeb, who is currently in charge of Minecraft development, has not announced anything about their current development status. \n Dinnerbone commented on Reddit that he would like to add pandas to Minecraft . [6] \n \n AI \n \n Main article: Mob AI \n \n Mobs will ordinarily wander around at random and usually avoid walking off cliffs high enough to cause falling damage (however, there are the rare and amusing sight in which a cow or sheep will walk of a cliff high enough to cause death), though they can be fooled by non-solid blocks such as trapdoors . In this state, mobs (besides Ghasts, Endermen, and Zombies after 1.6) have a search radius of 16 blocks. \n Mobs are capable of climbing ladders just as the player is: if they try to move towards a ladder they\'re touching they move up it instead. However, mobs do not see ladders nor do they purposely pathfind up them, so they will not attempt to avoid falling off a ladder should they be on the edge of one and they did not climb all walls. Spiders and Cave Spiders can climb all blocks as if they were ladders. \n All mobs except slimes will stop wandering within 5 seconds if there is no player within a 32 block radius. In this state, they will glance around randomly, but they won\'t walk anywhere. They can still be moved by other means such as flowing water , minecarts , etc. Zombies can walk when there is a villager they can attack even if they are over 32 blocks from a player, similarly villagers will flee when there is a zombie chasing them. \n Zombies, Skeletons, Creepers and Wolves have a more advanced path finding system compared to other mobs. Here is a video showcasing their path finding system . \n Hostile mobs \n If the closest player to a wandering hostile mob is within the search radius of 16 blocks and a line of sight can be drawn, (Spiders can always draw line of sight) the mob will enter pursuit mode. In this mode, mobs can see through all blocks and will walk towards the player. Some mobs, most notably skeletons and creepers, will start circling the player (moving to the left from the player\'s view) when close enough (skeletons at a long range for strafing, Creepers at a very short range). Zombies will sink in water, and whilst in pursuit mode, can path around walls to get to the player. When a hostile mob is attacked by another one, it will attack the attacking mob. For example, when a skeleton arrow hits a zombie, the zombie will attack the skeleton. Also, if a Creeper is killed by a Skeleton\'s arrow it will drop a music disc, provided that the Creeper does not kill the Skeleton first. \n Passive mobs \n Animals are attracted to both light and grass . If there is a lot of grass nearby, they will wander toward it regardless of light level. If they are completely surrounded by grass, they will wander aimlessly. If they can\'t see any grass, they will wander toward light. Passive mobs will flee randomly when attacked. Some passive mobs will follow a player if its currently held item is wheat , seeds, or raw fish. As long as the player does not get too far ahead of the mob, they will follow the player over long distances. This can be used to corral mobs into pens in order to make farms. If wheat is given to the mob by right clicking the mob, the mob will enter breed mode. This does not work with squids. No passive mob, except for squid and ocelots [ citation&#160;needed ] , will despawn if the player moves too far away from them. This also applies to wolves. \n Achievements \n \n Main article: Achievements \n \n \n \n Icon \n Achievement \n In-game description \n Prerequisites \n Actual requirements (if different) \n Version restriction \n Xbox points earned \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Monster Hunter \n Attack and destroy a monster \n Time to Strike! \n \n None \n 20G \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Sniper Duel \n Kill a skeleton with an arrow from more than 50 meters \n Monster Hunter \n "50 meters" is 50 blocks away. \n PC \n N/A \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Cow Tipper \n Harvest some leather \n Time to Strike! \n Pick up Leather from the ground. \n None \n 15G \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n When Pigs Fly \n Fly a pig off a cliff \n Cow Tipper \n Use a saddle to ride a pig, then have the pig get hurt from fall damage while riding it. \n None \n 40G \n \n \n Notes \n \n Mobs will frequently spawn in groups with mobs of the same variety. \n Mobs will not spawn on transparent blocks, in water (except for Squid ) or lava or half blocks ( slabs ), except from monster spawners , where they can even spawn in air. \n Mobs can not see through semi-transparent blocks such as ice , glass , or glass panes . Zombies however do have the ability to see through windows, and spiders can see through any block. \n Mobs have been found to spawn facing south. This includes with spawn eggs. \n Mobs can ride in minecarts . \n \n Bugs \n \n For bugs unique to specific mobs, see that mob\'s respective bug section. \n \n \n Mobs spin when on fences . \n \n Trivia \n \n \n \n  \nA pig emitting smoke upon death. \n \n \n \n Attempting to rename mobs "Dinnerbone" or "Grumm" with spawn eggs or name tags will flip them upside down. \n When a mob walks off a block they will sometimes turn around and get back on as if they didn\'t mean to get off of it, then walk off yet again and continue on their way. This can be useful when trying to get distance between you and a hostile mob (particularly Creepers ) \n When mobs die they emit puffs of smoke. This gives them the appearance of them turning to dust or vanishing in a puff of smoke. \n The Halloween Update version 1.2.0 (Alpha) allowed hostile mobs to spawn in higher light levels at lower depths, using the formula 16 - (Layer \xc3\xb7 8). At level 8 and below, mobs could spawn even in sunlight. Notch reverted mob spawning to the original method in version 1.2.1 (Alpha) saying, "It was far too annoying. I have plans on what to do with this." [7] \n Hostile mobs and players can hear up to 16 blocks away. Therefore, if the player hears a hostile mob, it is likely that the mob is aware of the player. \n Players can approach a hostile mob without being detected if they ensure that there are solid blocks between them and the mob. \n After killing a player, or if a player dies while hostile mobs are pursuing the player, the hostile mobs will gather around the player\'s deathplace, attempting to attack the player. This is because the player has been made invisible and non-solid, but still exists in that position. (evident by the "Game Over" screen still remaining in that position). The hostile mobs\' heads will "spazz out", a humorous glitch caused by the pathfinding of the mobs so it looks like the hostile mobs are eating the player. A player can use this to their advantage by holding a large number of hostile mobs over their deathplace while another player may pass by unnoticed. This quirk can also work against the player in the case of death by ghast, since (if there is another player present to keep the chunk loaded) the ghast will continue to fire at the player, possibly destroying more of the player\'s constructions or dropped items. The targeting of the player by the hostile mob is canceled once the player logs out, quits, or respawns. \n If a hostile mob has found a player and has activated hostile mode, the player can separate him or herself and the mob through a wall, relog, and the mob will no longer be in hostile mode. \n Mobs still spawn on peaceful, but disappear too quickly for most players to notice.\n \n Due to the Skeleton \'s tendency to shoot instantly on sight, players standing near a skeleton spawner on peaceful may be struck by an arrow during the instant when a skeleton spawns and disappears. This does not always happen but is more evident on a server due to lag. \n \n \n In the Pocket Edition , animals are attracted to water and will return to it if they are pushed out. Also, they cannot swim in deeper water, and will stay put until removed or slaughtered. \n On Halloween, 2012, Zombies , Zombie Villagers , Skeletons , Wither Skeletons and Zombie Pigmen had a chance of spawning a pumpkin on their head, with the rare chance of spawning with a Jack-O-Lantern instead. \n As of snapshot 13w04a mobs will not walk on top of rails unless pushed on to the rails by another mob. This can be used to trap small amounts of mobs, to create a wall between the player and a mob, or to prevent mobs from interrupting minecarts as they went down rails. \n \n References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/17279/how-far-can-mobs-see/ \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n Wikipedia: Mob \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/kml6r/notchs_new_snowman_mob_is_craftable_and_throws/c2lhmgx \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/s2oqp/i_am_erik_broes_aka_grum_developer_of_minecraft/c4aoa5d \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n https://twitter.com/notch/status/28068089223 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/s0pqt/i_am_nathan_adams_aka_dinnerbone_developer_of/c4a5sxc \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1486843146/minecraft-alpha-1-2-1-minecraft-server-0-2-3 \n \n \n \n Entities [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Entities/content \n \n \n \n \n Environment [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Environment/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Mobs&amp;oldid=504738 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Citation needed Entity Gameplay  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t View source \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Italiano \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t Portugu\xc3\xaas do Brasil \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 12 July 2013, at 21:15. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

Fire reduces health gradually and displays flames covering the entity. \n \n Entities can be pushed around by water currents. \n Entities cannot pass through solid blocks. Most types of entities prevent blocks from being placed in the space they occupy, except for resources (dropped items) which are automatically pushed out of the block to open air. Also, if an entity does overlap a block, such as due to falling sand or a door being swung, then it is free to move out of the solid block but not back in. (For example, if a door is closed on you, you can jump up and stand on top of the bottom half-door block, if there is air above the door.) \n Entities are lit according to the light level of the block their position is in. For example, if a minecart runs over a non-straight track directly into a solid block, it will turn black (since solid blocks always have a light level of 0), and arrows are sometimes seen to turn black (especially if fired shallowly into the ceiling). \n [ edit ] Types of entities \n The following types of entities currently exist in Minecraft. \n \n \n Kind \n Solid \n Drops \nwhen killed/destroyed \n Despawns \n Health \n Width \xc3\x97 Height \n Notes \n \n \n The Player \n Yes \n Their inventory \n No \n 20 (  \xc3\x97 10) \n 0.6\xc3\x971.8 \n Special case: Notch also drops an Apple . \n \n \n Mobs \n Yes \n see Drops \n see Spawn \n Varies \n Varies \n \n \n \n Boats \n Yes \n ( Sticks and Wooden Planks )if crashed, Boat if by a player \n No \n 6 (   ) \n 1.5\xc3\x970.6 \n Recovers health quickly over time. \nTakes damage from colliding with blocks or other entities at high speed. \n \n \n Minecarts \n Yes (except to other entities) \n 1 Minecart \n No \n 6 (   ) \n 0.98\xc3\x970.7 \n Recovers health quickly over time. \nSnaps to rails if in a block occupied by them. \n \n \n Items \n Only to boats and minecarts \n None \n 5 minutes \n - \n 0.25\xc3\x970.25 \n Destroyed by explosions/fire/lava/cacti, but cannot be struck. \n \n \n Experience Orb \n No \n None \n 5 minutes \n - \n 0.3\xc3\x970.3 \n Same behaviors as dropped items; also attracted to the player. \n \n \n Projectile arrows \n Yes (to boats in water and minecarts on rails) \n n/a \n 1 minute \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n 0.5\xc3\x970.5 \n Damages other entities if moving; harmless when stuck in a block . \n \n \n Projectile snowballs , chicken eggs \n Breaks on impact \n n/a \n No \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n 0.25\xc3\x970.25 \n Eggs may spawn a chicken on impact. \n \n \n Projectile Ender Pearl \n Breaks on impact \n n/a \n No \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n 0.25\xc3\x970.25 \n Teleports player on impact. \n \n \n Thrown Eye of Ender \n No \n Eye of Ender after flight (1:5 chance of shattering) \n No \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n 0.25\xc3\x970.25 \n Floats towards the closest stronghold. \n \n \n Launched Firework Rocket \n No \n n/a \n Varies (explodes) \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n &#160;? \n \n \n \n Primed TNT \n No \n n/a \n 4 seconds or fewer \n(Explodes) \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n 0.98\xc3\x970.98 \n \n \n \n Falling sand / gravel / Dragon egg / anvil \n No \n Itself as an item (unless hits ground) \n Once entity hits ground or ~4 seconds \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n 0.98\xc3\x970.98 \n Drops sand/gravel/dragon egg/anvil when landing in a non-solid block such as a slab . \n \n \n Fishing Rod bobber \n Only to boats and minecarts \n n/a \n 1 minute \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n &#160;? \n \n \n \n Lightning bolt \n No \n n/a \n Half a second \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n &#160;? \n \n \n \n Paintings and Item Frames \n No \n 1 Painting or Item Frame (if Item Frame , will drop item inside) \n No \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n Varies \n Drops as an item when struck \n \n \n Ghast and Blaze Fireballs \n Explodes on impact/deflected on hit \n n/a \n 1 minute \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n 1.0\xc3\x971.0 (Ghast), 0.3125\xc3\x970.3125 (Blaze) \n Only Ghast Fireballs can be deflected, Blaze Fireballs cannot \n \n \n Ender Crystal \n Yes \n n/a \n No \n 5 (   ) \n &#160;? \n Explodes when struck by anything, regardless of damage inflicted \n \n \n Entities listed as \xe2\x80\x9csolid\xe2\x80\x9d obstruct the passage of other entities. \n The size is in block lengths (usually considered to be 1 meter), and is the size of an axis-aligned bounding box with the specified width in both horizontal dimensions (X and Z) and the specified height in the Y dimension. This box does not rotate as the object rotates visually. \n For a listing of numeric entity IDs, see Data values . \n [ edit ] Motion of entities \n Gravity works differently in Minecraft than the real world, as not everything is subject to the same acceleration. Additionally, there is a drag force proportional to velocity, again dependent on the entity. \n \n \n Kind \n Acceleration \nblocks/ tick 2 \n Acceleration \nm/s 2 \n Drag \n1/tick \n Terminal velocity \nblocks/tick \n Terminal velocity \nm/s \n \n \n Players and other living entities \n 0.08 \n 32 \n 0.02 \n 3.92 \n 78.4 \n \n \n Items , falling blocks, TNT \n 0.04 \n 16 \n 0.02 \n 1.96 \n 39.2 \n \n \n Boats and Minecarts \n 0.04 \n 16 \n 0.05 \n 0.76 \n 15.2 \n \n \n Thrown Eggs , Snowballs , Potions , and Ender Pearls \n 0.03 \n 12 \n 0.01 \n 3.00 \n 60.0 \n \n \n Fired Arrows \n 0.05 \n 20 \n 0.01 \n 5.00 \n 100.0 \n \n \n Note that when thrown objects and arrows are simulated, the drag is applied before the acceleration, rather than after; this is why their terminal velocities are nice whole numbers where the others aren\'t. \n [ edit ] Further notes \n Item frames and paintings are entities, but they are unusual in that they are aligned to the block grid and completely immobile. Doors , portals and beds , the other objects larger than a single block, are actually groups of adjacent blocks. \n Arrows, TNT, sand, and gravel are assumed to have infinite health because they are not destroyed by multiple TNT explosions (they can be fired out of cannons ), nor by being on fire for long periods. \n [ edit ] Boats and Minecarts \n \n See also: Transportation (contains information about speeds) \n \n Boats and minecarts appear to recover health over time. For example, they can be broken by hitting them quick, but cannot be destroyed by hits with unarmed hand with same pause after each hit. The amount of wobbling displayed by boats and minecarts when struck appears to indicate their current health. \n [ edit ] Sand and Gravel \n The following description refers to sand for brevity, but gravel behaves in exactly the same way. \n Sand normally exists as a block. When a sand block\'s support is removed, it turns into a sand entity and falls down until it hits another object, at which point it places itself as a block in the nearest on-grid position, or turns into a sand resource if that position is occupied (such as by a torch ). While sand ordinarily falls straight down, it can be redirected while falling by explosions and pistons . It is also possible to modify the velocity and direction of a falling sand by using third party programs. \n If when the world is created, a cave is generated underneath sand, Minecraft will fail to update the block (as said in the code to not make sand fall when it is generated) and the sand will remain floating until a block is changed under, above, or beside it. This latter fact means that a single falling sand block can trigger the collapse of an entire region of sand; therefore, sand ceilings should not be disturbed unless one is outside the area, standing over a torch, or prepared to dig out quickly once the sand has fallen. \n [ edit ] Right-clicking \n Entities with right-click actions ( boats , minecarts , ocelots and wolves ), unlike blocks with right-click actions (such as chests ), do not stop the right-click action of a tool you are holding. For example, if you right-click on a tamed wolf with a water bucket in your hand, the wolf will sit, but you will also empty the bucket at the wolf. \n [ edit ] Riding \n Entities may be riding on, or attached to, other entities. When this is the case, only the lower/"outer" entity\'s volume collides with other things, and only that entity can control movement. The currently possible combinations are: \n \n A mob or player in a minecart or boat . \n A player on a saddled pig . \n A skeleton on a spider ( Spider Jockey ). \n A player on a horse (13w16a and above) \n \n It is possible to have multiple levels, such as a player on a pig in a minecart. \n Also, entities can be stacked on top of each other but only with third party programs. \n If an entity is riding another entity, the top entity cannot teleport, whether by ender pearl, command, or some other reason. This also applies if a tamed wolf or ocelot is riding a minecart. Technically speaking, as soon as the teleport is made, the entity is teleported back to riding the other entity. Since Minecraft smooths out movements by showing entities at locations between new and old positions, this may result in seeing the entity at several locations between riding the other entity and their teleport location. \n [ edit ] History \n \n In Creative mode (Minecraft Beta 1.8 to Release 1.1), the player could interact with entities (attack or \'right-click\' action) from far away \xe2\x80\x94 even if there were blocks in the way. This was very annoying (although, useful for long-range mob attacks). For example, when you tried to break a stone block, and there was a painting on the other side of the block, the stone would not break, but the painting would. Also, when you tried to place a block on a wall, and there was a minecart behind that wall, you would enter the minecart, as if you had clicked it directly, instead of placing the block. \n As of 12w34a, entities can travel to the Nether or the End via portal ; this resulted in many bugs. \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/hvkmo/attribution_of_the_piston_mod_in_vanilla_minecraft/ \n \n \n \n Entities [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Entities/content \n \n \n \n \n Environment [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Environment/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Entity&amp;oldid=503213 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Category : Environment  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t \xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 9 July 2013, at 04:03. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

In addition, tile entities are able to perform an action each tick. Tile entities are detailed in the Chunk format page. Tile Entities are not moveable by pistons . \n The blocks which have tile data are: \n \n Signs , to store the text to be displayed. \n Chests , Dispensers , Furnaces , Brewing Stands , Hoppers , Droppers and Beacons to store their contents. Furnaces also store the time until the current item is smelted, and the time until the furnace\'s current fuel item is exhausted. Brewing Stands also store the brewing time. \n Monster Spawners , to store which mob will be spawned, additional data about the mob to be spawned, the time until the next mob is spawned, the min and max values for the next spawn delay, and how many mobs to spawn per spawn attempt. \n Note Blocks , to store which note will be played. \n Blocks being moved by pistons, to store the offset of block, direction of movement, and ID of moving block. \n Jukeboxes , if and which music disc is inside. \n Enchanting Tables , for the floating book. \n End Portals and Ender Chests , for the particle field effect. \n Mob heads , for the type of the head and optionally the player represented. \n Command Block , for the command used. \n Nether Reactor Cores , to store whether the reaction started and the time remaining in the reaction. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Entities , which are objects that may move around and are not blocks. \n \n \n \n \n Minecraft by Mojang AB and 4J Studios \n \n \n

Together, they build up the in-game environment, and can be mined and utilized in various fashions. There are one hundred and fifty three different blocks. \n The face of a block is 16\xc3\x9716 pixels, and each block is proportionately one cubic meter. [1] Most blocks are static, although water , lava , portal , and fire blocks have a shifting pattern for each face. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 World-generated blocks \n \n 1.1 The Overworld \n \n 1.1.1 Naturally generated \n 1.1.2 Naturally created \n 1.1.3 Structures \n \n \n 1.2 The Nether \n \n 1.2.1 Naturally generated \n 1.2.2 Naturally created \n 1.2.3 Structures \n \n \n 1.3 The End \n \n 1.3.1 Naturally generated \n 1.3.2 Naturally created \n \n \n \n \n 2 Block height \n 3 History \n 4 Bugs \n 5 See also \n 6 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] World-generated blocks \n Entries marked with a D require additional data values to fully define the block in a Minecraft world.

Operators of servers could also build Bedrock . Some custom servers gave the ability to place grass and fluid blocks, too. \n \n \n Pocket Edition Alpha \n \n \n Pre-release \n Added exclusive camera and cyan flower . \n \n \n 0.5.0 \n Added exclusive Nether Reactor and Glowing Obsidian . \n \n \n 0.6.0 \n Added exclusive Stonecutter . \n \n \n [ edit ] Bugs \n \n When placing a block in any version of Minecraft with a slow, laggy computer, two blocks may be placed when only clicking once, and when attempting to remove one block, two blocks may be removed. This also happens with doors. People with particularly low-end hardware may even experience three blocks being placed or removed with one click of the mouse. A good way of combating this problem is by reducing the render distance or by using mods like optifine to change the game settings and speed up the game. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Data values \n Opacity \n Light \n Items \n Ore \n Technical blocks \n Generated structures \n Altitude \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://notch.tumblr.com/post/422515389/clearing-up-the-world-size-math \n \n \n \n \n Blocks [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Blocks/content \n \n \n \n \n Environment [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Environment/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Blocks&amp;oldid=504063 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Blocks Environment  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t Italiano \n\t\t\t \xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t Portugu\xc3\xaas do Brasil \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 10 July 2013, at 23:12. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

Blocked attacks deal only half the normal damage they normally would. Blocking does not decrease the sword\'s durability. \n While blocking, the player moves at a speed slower than if they were sneaking . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 History \n 2 Bugs \n 3 Trivia \n 4 Gallery \n 5 See also \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.8pre1 \n Added blocking. \n \n \n 1.8pre2 \n Prior to this version, blocking didn\'t block any damage in multiplayer . \n \n \n 1.9pre1 \n Prior to this version, the player only changed the position of their sword. This was changed in said update, where the player also moved their hand outwards. Players used to be able to rise faster when blocking while swimming underwater, and attacking while blocking used to only register when the player stopped blocking. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0.0 \n Before 1.0, blocking could decrease fall damage, allowing the player to fall 42 blocks without dying, instead of 22. \n \n \n [ edit ] Bugs \n \n If the player presses the attack and block button at the same time whilst in third person perspective , the sword appears to cut the player\'s head. \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n The blocking movement complemented with the sneaking mechanic is the gradable opposition of the sprinting mechanic. \n Taking damage while blocking does not decrease the durability of your sword. \n Blocking allows for the slowest movements possible. This can occur when the player blocks, sneaks , and moves backward while under the effect of the slowness potion while going through cobwebs placed above still water on top of Soul Sand that is placed on top of ice . This causes the player to move at about 1/32 blocks a second, (needs recalculation after new additions) or 1/2 pixel a second (1 Pixel every 12-13s w/ new calculations) on a default 16x16 texture pack. Blocking while sneaking and with the additional events (but without slowness potion) allows the player go at roughly 0.023854961832 blocks per second (1 block every 41.92 seconds). \n It is possible to mine blocks while blocking, which causes the mining animation to be combined with the blocking position giving a strange animation, making the sword appear to be spinning. \n If a player continuously presses the attack and block keys in quick succession, the player can deal damage at a higher clip rate. This technique is called block-hitting. \n If the player blocks while being shot by a skeleton , the arrow the skeleton fires may sometimes bounce off of the player , but it will still deal damage. \n When using a slowness effect instead of a potion in the newer update to achieve the slowest possible speed, the command /effect (playername) (slowness ID) (time) (efficiency ,1-255) can be used. but when the amount of the effect is to high, the effect will not take place but will be shown in the character\'s screen. this can be undone by drinking milk, logging of or type the same messages the player used to get the buff, which was bugged, this also works for working buffs but these need to be added by the /effect command. \n Some people block on multiplayer to show they are a friend or foe. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The player blocking an incoming creeper explosion with an iron sword. \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Sprinting \n Critical hit \n \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Blocking&amp;oldid=498629 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Category : Gameplay  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t \xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 28 June 2013, at 21:42. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

The default player is popularly known as Steve and is confirmed on the \'Profile\' page near the section that allows you to change your skin, a name suggested by Notch as a joke, [1] and is intended to be a generic, genderless representation of a human being, [2] although the player\'s skin can be changed. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Appearance \n 2 Differences in other editions \n \n 2.1 Pocket Edition \n 2.2 Xbox 360 Edition \n \n \n 3 Health \n 4 Movement \n 5 Gameplay HUD \n 6 Experience \n 7 Modes \n 8 Customization \n 9 History \n 10 Trivia \n 11 See also \n 12 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Appearance \n The default player\'s skin (typically known as Steve) has dark brown hair, brownish skin, and indigo eyes, with a cyan-blue shirt (un-tucked on the left hand side and in the back), a pair of indigo jeans, and grayish-black shoes. Steve seems to have a slight stubble of a light brown beard. In the Xbox 360 edition the player\'s default skin can vary from Steve to seven other player skins (stated below). These skins now have names with the Xbox 1.7.3 update and are listed below. Multiple skin packs are available for purchase on the Xbox Live Marketplace. \n [ edit ] Differences in other editions \n [ edit ] Pocket Edition \n In the Pocket Edition , the player still makes the "oof" sound. In iOS versions of the Pocket Edition, Steve is named Stevie. In Android versions of the game, he is named Steve, as normal. A rare glitch in this edition allows a player clone to appear in multiplayer which mimics the player. \n [ edit ] Xbox 360 Edition \n In the Xbox 360 Edition , there are 8 defaulted versions of Steve for the player to use (as well as many packs of new skins featuring non-Steve characters from various video games, such as \'Splosion Man from his titular indie game and Master Chief from the Halo series).There are also skins featuring different mobs, such as skeletons, zombies, enderdragon, all those.The 8 default skins are Steve, Boxer Steve, Cyclist Steve,Tennis Steve, Scottish Steve, Prisoner Steve, Tuxedo Steve, and Athlete Steve. Some variants of Steve look nothing like him, while others are him with different clothes. \n [ edit ] Health \n \n Main articles: Health and Damage \n \n The player has 10 full hearts.1 full heart represents 2 health . When the player\'s hunger bar is at 9 points or higher, their health will slowly regenerate by half a heart every five seconds. The hunger bar depletes faster when the player does things like sprinting, jumping, attacking mobs, and mining, and it can be refilled by eating food . If the hunger bar is at 8 and a half points or lower, the player will not regenerate health unless in peaceful mode (or under the effect of certain potions ). If the hunger bar is down to 0, the player will start starving and losing health. On hard difficulty, starvation will kill you. On normal difficulty, it will bring you down to half of a heart. On easy difficulty, it will bring you down to 5 hearts. On peaceful difficulty the health bar will recover regardless of hunger but will still take starvation damage, and the hunger bar will not lose any points, even when under the effect of food poisoning. \n [ edit ] Movement \n \n Main article: Controls#Configurable controls \n \n \n Note: the numerical values used in this section are approximations based on experimentation. Slight variation from true values is possible, based on human error, and so each value also lists an error range. \n \n The player walks at a rate of 4.31(\xc2\xb10.2) blocks per second. This means that they can walk a total of 5172 blocks in one Minecraft day. \n \n Main article: Sprinting \n \n As of Beta 1.8, the player is able to sprint, [3] draining the food bar considerably (10\xc3\x97) faster than usual while doing so. [4] The player is capable of sprinting approximately 5.55(\xc2\xb10.02) blocks per second, as opposed to the regular pace of 4.31. The player can jump four blocks horizontally when sprinting. The player cannot sprint if there are only 3 bars or fewer left in the hunger meter. By default, sprinting is activated by double-tapping the forward key (default W ) then holding it. \n \n Main article: Sneaking \n \n Sneaking is a feature activated by holding the sneak key (default is \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift ). Sneaking prevents players from falling one or more blocks, making it highly useful for building horizontally outwards over empty space. However, if the sneak button is released while beyond the edge of a block, the player will fall down. Additionally, the player can still dismount blocks while sneaking by jumping over the block\'s edge. \n Note: In current versions of the game, if you are past the edge of the block and you stop sneaking, you will not fall off of that block, as it has been changed so that it will not put you past the block, but only at the very edge of that block. \n In Creative mode, the player flies at 10.88(\xc2\xb10.06) blocks per second. \n \n \n Movement Mode \n Speed (m/s) \n Speed (km/h) \n \n \n Walking \n 4.3 \n 15.5 \n \n \n Sprinting \n 5.6 \n 20.2 \n \n \n Sneaking \n 1.3 \n 4.7 \n \n \n Flying \n 10.8 \n 38.9 \n \n \n \n Main article: Jumping \n \n The maximum height a player can jump if without mods or the status effect "jump boost" is 1.249 blocks. \n [ edit ] Gameplay HUD \n The onscreen heads-up display (HUD) consists of the player\'s health bar, hunger bar , experience bar, and hotbar. The armor rating bar appears above the health bar if the player is wearing armor and the oxygen bar appears if the player is submerged in water . The HUD also contains the crosshair, and held object (or fist). The HUD can also be toggled by F1 . \n [ edit ] Experience \n \n Main article: Experience \n \n Experience points can be gained via experience orbs when killing mobs. The current level is indicated by a green number above the HUD, and the experience points can be used to enchant weapons, tools or armor with different useful attributes and skills (see enchanting table .) Anvils require experience to use. \n The level increases by obtaining enough experience points. All levels and experience are lost upon death, but can be partially restored by picking up the experience orbs at the place of death. [5] \n Experience is also obtained through activities such as mining, smelting (experience is only given when already-smelted items are taken out of the furnace), fishing, and animal breeding. \n [ edit ] Modes \n \n Main articles: Survival , Creative , Hardcore and Adventure \n \n \n In Survival mode, the player is able to place and destroy blocks, and use all tools available. The player has limited health (heart icons), hunger (drumstick icons), and oxygen (bubble icons) and it takes time to break blocks. \n In Creative mode, the player has the ability to fly by double tapping the Space key and to place infinite number of blocks, but with limited use of crafting and tools. The player cannot take damage (except from falling into the Void, or, with cheats enabled, typing the command "/kill"), has no hunger and has unlimited oxygen, and breaking blocks is instantaneous. \n In Hardcore mode, the player cannot respawn and the difficulty level is locked on hard mode. (If playing on a hardcore multiplayer server, the player is automatically banned from that server when they die.) \n In Adventure mode, there are no changes from Survival mode aside from being unable to break blocks without the correct tool. The gamemode can only be played by having cheats enabled and typing the command /gamemode 2 or /gamemode adventure , /gamemode a , or opening a multiplayer (including LAN) world. \n \n [ edit ] Customization \n \n Main article: Skin \n \n Users can change their character\'s skins; this can be done on the Preferences page of Minecraft.net by uploading a PNG image file, which will then replace the default skin. \n The Xbox 360 Edition has a separate default skin for each player. The ability to change that skin is currently now available using the Change Skin option in the game and Skin Packs 1 through 4 have been released. Skin packs that have now been removed from Xbox Live include the Summer of Arcade Skin Pack, the Halloween Charity Skin Pack, and the Festive Skin Pack. \n In the Pocket Edition , the player uses the default skin, and it can be changed by changing the char.png in the game\'s files or using external apps on both iOS and Android. \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n \n  \nThe armor bar as it appeared before the Adventure Update. \n \n \n Before Alpha 1.0.14 , the walking animation for the player was different; the player swung their arms wildly to their sides while walking as can be seen in the file archives , and in a video of Minecraft Classic from 2009 as well as in the video Zombie Town by Notch, which features the removed human mob. This animation is still used in Classic . \n After the Beta update, the default texture for the player was replaced with a beardless version. The bearded version is still obtainable by downloading the reference skin . The bearded version can often be mistaken for a smiley face. \n Before the Adventure Update , the armor bar had appeared in the position that the hunger bar is currently at now. \n The player can jump one block high, and two blocks long (in Classic , three blocks long). Since Beta 1.8 Pre-release 1 , the player can jump 4 blocks horizontally if sprinting. \n The player did not have an experience or hunger bar before Beta 1.8 pre1 . \n Before Minecraft RC2, when the player was damaged, he would make a deep "Ooh!" sound which represented the player\'s response when hurt. However, this sound suggested that the player was male, which was not consistent with/representative of female player skins, so Mojang changed the sound to make it more gender-neutral, and, as of RC2, any physical damage will play a flesh impact sound, and damage from falling would play sounds like bones breaking. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n The player\'s eye level (According to coordinates while pressing F3 ) is 1.62 meters. Since his eyes are 29 pixels above his feet, leaving 3 pixels above his eyes (.17m), Steve is approximately 1.79 meters tall (5\'10"). This seems to be confirmed by the game\'s code that shows Steve\'s hitbox being 1.8m tall and 0.6m wide. \n When hitboxes are toggled on (By pressing F3 and B ) the visible hitbox for the player actually starts at the player\'s neck and goes over the player\'s head as if it is the right size but standing on the player\'s shoulders. This does not appear to be the player\'s actual hitbox as skeletons can still shoot you in the feet. This may be a bug \n Zombies wear the same clothing as Steve. This has led to the discussion whether zombies are actually the dead bodies of past Steves. \n The player is right handed as they hold weapons, like swords, in their right hand. But they are left eye dominant, meaning they shoot left handed by holding the stock of a bow in their right hand. An easy way of seeing this is by charging a bow and pressing F5 . \n Steve is featured as a Micro Mob along with a creeper in the LEGO set 21102 LEGO Minecraft Micro World . \n The player seems to have peripheral vision. Lights and lit objects are more visible near the edges of the display (only with graphics set to "fast"). \n Steve is also an unlockable character in the Steam version of the game Super Meat Boy under the name "Mr. Minecraft". He has shorter jump height than other characters, and can mine squares from the level and place them as platforms. \n Steve\'s head is an unlockable helmet in the Xbox Arcade game, Hybrid . \n Steve\'s head is a wearable item in the game Borderlands 2 . \n Steve\'s head is able to be bought in the flash game "Fantasy Online", under the name "Minehead". \n Steve\'s terminal velocity is 162 km/h (100 mph), less than the average human\'s, about 190 km/h (120 mph). \n The Player appears to be very strong, being able to carry an entire inventory of gold blocks, which would weigh nearly 45,000 metric tons. However, it\'s possible the player\'s inventory goes to some kind of hyperspace ; after all, he doesn\'t look like he\'s carrying around a small mountain. \n Upon death, the player has the same death animation as any other mob, which is keeling over to the side and disappearing into a cloud of smoke (while viewed in third-person view or when the inventory is open). To other players, the player merely disappears. This was fixed in 1.6. \n The Player appears to be very experienced in jumping, as he can jump over 1 meter high (one block). \n Sometimes when you eat something, you can actually hear the player burp. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Steve (mob) \n Human \n Mobs \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n https://twitter.com/notch/status/6825860292157440 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n wordofnotch:28188312756 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n wordofnotch:7276719413 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n https://twitter.com/notch/status/108938691862470656 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/07/20/first-details-on-minecrafts-xp-system-notch-when-you-die-you-lose-all-levels-you-lose-all-xp \n \n \n \n \n Entities [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Entities/content \n \n \n \n \n Environment [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Environment/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Player&amp;oldid=504574 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Environment Entity  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t \xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 12 July 2013, at 14:02. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

At that point, it had been stated that the player avatar would look like Steve in the future, albeit with a miner hat and a different skin . \n Steve was made by " Dock ", Minecraft\'s past artist, as were the similar looking Rana , Black Steve and Beast Boy . All four of them were scrapped when Dock left the development team. The player model remains the same as the now removed Human NPC. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Appearance \n 2 Trivia \n 3 Other links \n 4 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Appearance \n Steve, like The Player , has brown hair. He has rectangular brown eyes, and also brown eyebrows. He has a blue shirt and a brown belt. He has brown gloves, and brown pants with blue shoes. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n \n \n  \nSteve in-game. \n \n \n \n The current Minecraft player model appears in Super Meat Boy as a playable character called Steve. Notch is not sure that this is his official name, as he puts a question mark symbol after it. [1] \n Steve, as well as all the other mobs made by Dock, have no animation because of inability of MD3 loader. They just glide around in the same pose.

For mob spawners, see Monster Spawner . For the player, see The Player . \n Spawning refers to players and mobs being created and placed in the game world. Players will respawn at their spawn point, or at the bed they last slept in upon death . Mobs will despawn upon death. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Player spawning \n 2 Animal spawning \n 3 Mob spawning \n \n 3.1 Notes \n \n \n 4 History \n 5 Issues \n 6 Other types of spawning \n 7 Despawning \n 8 Trivia \n 9 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Player spawning \n For a more precise explanation of player spawning in multiplayer, see: Spawn/Multiplayer Details . \n Since Minecraft version 1.3, players in both singleplayer and multiplayer will spawn, by default, anywhere within a 20x20 area centered at the world spawn point. An individual player can change their spawn point by merely lying in a bed\xe2\x80\x94they do not have to go to sleep (which can only happen if all players use a bed at the same time). \n On multiplayer servers, a 33x33 block area centered at the default spawn point, and spanning the full height of the map, is "protected". Players, other than server operators , cannot place or destroy blocks in the protected area, use doors, activate switches other than pressure plates , or open chests or other blocks which contain items. Creepers can still destroy terrain in the protected area and TNT placed outside of the protected area will destroy surrounding blocks as usual. Along with this, portals from the nether can connect to the protected area, water/lava/fire can spread from outside into the protected area, and pistons can push items inside as well. Players can place blocks on the edge of the protected area if placed against the side of a block on the outside of the area. However, if the edges of the protected area are avoided, small, indestructible structures can be built. Paintings that are put up can be removed by players in the safe zone. \n [ edit ] Animal spawning \n Approximately one in ten newly generated chunks will contain mobs , usually in packs of up to four of the same species. They will always spawn on the highest available block in a column i.e. the one that can see the sky. For an animal to spawn on it, this block must be opaque and the two blocks above it must be transparent. The block does not need to be grass nor does it need to be illuminated (as it does with Mob Spawning ). \n Animals do not spawn in desert or ocean biomes , with the exception of squid . \n \n \n \n  \nA cow that generated with the map inside a tree\'s leaves and could not escape, a common sight in forested hill areas. \n \n \n Randomness for animal spawning is derived from the world seed , which means that worlds with the same seed will generate chunks with the same animals in the same places. \n Very rarely, new animals can spawn in already generated chunks, just like monsters do . When animals spawn in this way, they do so only on grass blocks with light level 9 or greater above them. This is also a requirement for animals spawning from monster spawners . Unlike monsters, animals do not spontaneously despawn , except for wild ocelots and wolves (which can despawn only when they are hostile). \n [ edit ] Mob spawning \n Mobs are broadly divided into four categories: hostile, friendly, water (i.e. Squid ) and ambient (i.e. Bat ). Hostile mobs have a spawning cycle once every game tick (1/20th of a second). Friendly and water mobs have only one spawning cycle every 400 ticks (20 seconds). Because of this, hostile mobs can spawn at any time, but animals spawn very rarely. Instead, most animals spawn within chunks when they are generated. \n Mobs spawn naturally within a 15x15 chunk (240x240 block) area around the player. When there are multiple players, mobs can spawn within this distance of any of them. However, mobs that move farther than 128 blocks from any player will immediately despawn (see Despawning ), so the mob spawning area is effectively limited to spheres with a radius of 128 blocks, centered at each player. \n Mob caps are directly proportional to the total number of chunks eligible for spawning. To calculate the cap, the spawning area is expanded by one chunk in every direction, so that it is 17x17 chunks in size, and then the total number of chunks is plugged into the following formula: \n \n cap = constant * chunks / 256\n \n Each mob category has a separate cap and a different constant in the formula: \n \n Hostile = 70\n Passive = 10\n Ambient (Bats) = 15\n Water = 5\n \n In single player mode, the chunk count is 17x17 = 289, and the caps work out to: \n \n Hostile = 79\n Passive = 11\n Ambient = 16\n Water = 5\n \n In multiplayer, chunks that are in range of multiple players are only counted once. So the more spread out the players are, the more chunks will be covered and the higher the caps will be. \n The cap is checked once at the beginning of each spawning cycle. If the number of living mobs in a category is over its cap, the entire spawning cycle for that category is skipped. \n \n \n \n  \nExample of a mob pack spawning. The 41x1x41 spawning area is shaded blue (not to scale). The yellow figures represent the actual positions that mobs could spawn in after checking the environment. Note that the mobs can spawn inside torch and ladder blocks. But they can\'t spawn on top of glass because it\'s not opaque. The red cube is the center of the pack, which must be an air block, but the blocks above and below it can be anything. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nRequirements for the spawning location of individual mobs \n \n \n For each spawning cycle, one attempt is made to spawn a pack of mobs in each eligible chunk. A random location in the chunk is chosen to be the center point of the pack. For the pack to spawn at all, the center block must be water for water mobs and air for all other mobs. Note that in the latter case, it must actually be an air block. Any other block, even a non-colliding one, will prevent the entire pack from spawning . \n If the pack location is suitable, 12 attempts are made to spawn up to 4 mobs (8 for Wolves , 1 for Ghasts ) within a 41x1x41 area centered at that block (that\'s a 41x41 square that is one block high). Mobs will spawn with the lowest part of their body inside this area. For each spawn attempt, a block location within the pack area is chosen at random. Though the pack area extends 21 blocks out from the center, the random location is heavily skewed toward the center of the pack. Approximately 85% of spawns will be within 5 blocks of the pack center, and 99% within 10 blocks of the center. \n All mobs within a pack are the same species. The species for the entire pack is chosen randomly from those eligible to spawn at the location of the first spawn attempt in the pack: \n \n In the Overworld , this depends on the biome :\n \n Most biomes can spawn sheep , pigs , chickens , cows , spiders , zombies , skeletons , creepers , Endermen , Slimes (only in certain chunks if not in a swamp), and Squid . \n Forest and taiga biomes can also spawn Wolves . \n Jungle biomes can also spawn Ocelots . \n Desert, beach, river, and ocean biomes cannot spawn animals; only hostile mobs and Squid . \n Mushroom biomes can spawn only Mooshrooms . \n \n \n There are actually two ways for a Slime to naturally spawn without a Monster Spawner : In any eligible chunk under layer 40, or in a swamp biome at a low light level. \n Cave spiders spawn only from their specific Mob Spawners , which are found in Abandoned Mine Shafts among many cobwebs . \n Silverfish spawn from special stone, cobblestone, and stone brick blocks found in strongholds and extreme hills biomes. They also spawn from specific spawners found in strongholds. \n Blazes spawn from their specific spawners in Nether Fortresses and can also spawn elsewhere in the structures. \n Wither Skeletons and Skeletons can spawn in Nether Fortresses . \n The Nether itself can spawn only Ghasts , Zombie Pigmen , and Magma Cubes . \n The End can spawn only Endermen . \n The Ender Dragon spawns naturally in The End; but only one, ever; and not as part of the general mob spawning process. \n Snow Golems , Iron Golems , and Withers only spawn when built with the exception of Iron Golems spawning in villages with 10 villagers and enough houses. \n \n Each individual spawn attempt succeeds only if all of the following conditions are met: \n \n There must be no players and no player spawn points within a 24 block distance (spherical) of the spawning block \n \n \n If it\'s a squid , then...\n \n the spawning block must contain liquid ( water or lava ) \n the spawning block must be between level 45 and 62, inclusive \n the spawning mob must not be obstructed by other mobs \n \n \n \n \n If it\'s not a squid, then...\n \n the spawning block itself must be non- opaque and non- liquid \n the block directly below it must be opaque or upside down slabs / stairs and may not be bedrock \n the block directly above it must be non-opaque \n the spawning mob must not be obstructed by solid blocks, other mobs or liquids \n \n \n \n \n If it\'s an animal, then...\n \n the block directly below the spawning block must be grass \n the light level of the spawning block must be 9 or brighter \n \n \n \n \n if it\'s an ocelot , then...\n \n the spawning block must be above level 62 \n the block directly below the spawning block must be grass or leaves \n there is a 1/3 chance the spawn will fail \n \n \n \n \n If it\'s a hostile mob in the overworld, then...\n \n the light level of the spawning block must be 7 or darker, and more light increases the chance that the spawn will fail \n sunlight falling on the spawning block further increases the chance that the spawn will fail, by up to 50% \n \n \n \n \n If it\'s a Slime , then...\n \n the spawning block must be in a chunk eligible to spawn slimes (see the Slime page for details) \n the spawning block must be below level 40 \n if the spawn is in a swamp biome, the light level just has to be low \n there is an additional 90% chance the spawn will fail, thus slimes only spawn 1/10th as often as other mobs, all other things being equal \n \n \n \n \n If it\'s a Ghast , then there is a 95% chance the spawn will fail, thus ghasts only spawn 1/20th as often as other mobs \n \n If all of these conditions are met then the mob is spawned. The pack is complete when 4 mobs have spawned (or 8 wolves, or 1 ghast), or 12 attempts have been made, whichever comes first. The exception(s) to these rules is the Enderdragon \n [ edit ] Notes \n \n Due to the general block checks, all mobs besides squid must spawn on top of an opaque block with at least two blocks of headroom, even ghasts, etc. However, short mobs can spawn in a one block high space if the block above is transparent, like a glass block or piston . \n While individual mobs can spawn inside signs, pressure plates, and other non-opaque blocks, packs cannot . They need a completely empty block in the center. Since a pack spawns all at one level, there needs to be some air blocks right above a flat surface to allow mobs to spawn on it, and more air blocks will always allow more spawning. \n Similarly, buildings surrounded by air will spawn more mobs inside than underground rooms because packs that spawn outside of the building can spawn mobs inside it. \n The mob caps tend to be reached in seconds. Because of this, mobs can be funneled into a spawning room by preventing them from spawning outside of it. \n The caps also mean that the faster mobs are killed, the faster they will spawn. \n Because the caps are only checked at the beginning of a spawn cycle, they can be dramatically exceeded when a large number of mobs spawn in a single cycle. This happens often with squid , which have a fairly low cap (5 in single player) but can spawn in the hundreds in a single cycle, in an area with lots of water . \n In multiplayer, mob caps are shared by all players, no matter where they are. If one player can make a lot of mobs spawn near them, say, with a mob farm , players elsewhere in the world will see fewer mobs of the same category. Likewise, if a player can prevent mobs from spawning near them, perhaps by hanging around a large body of water and illuminating nearby caves, they will effectively dump their mobs on everyone else. \n Mobs used to not spawn above y co-ordinate 240 due to a bug, but as of 1.4.6 this is fixed and mobs now can spawn above level 240. \n In multiplayer, if the server.properties file has "view-distance=9" or below, mob spawning is severely reduced (or they de-spawn too quickly), and may result in the player encountering no mobs at all. Set the view distance to 10 or higher to ensure mobs spawn correctly. \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Classic \n \n \n \n The spawning area used to be 17x17 chunks rather than 15x15. The area was reduced, but the old size is still used to calculate mob caps. \n \n \n It was not always possible to funnel mobs into a spawning room by preventing them from spawning elsewhere. Some older sources of information about spawning might make reference to this. \n \n \n Large amounts of empty space used to encourage spawning in the general area. This remains true on a smaller scale, and only horizontally, due to pack spawning. \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 0.2.0 \n The chunk 0,0 (X 0-16 and Z 0-16) is no longer always the first chunk evaluated for mob spawning. If one built a dark room inside that chunk, all mobs would spawn inside that room and nowhere else. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.8 \n The spawn location is no longer always on sand or gravel, even if it wasn\'t on a beach. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0.0 \n Previously, spawn was determined by light level rather than the current chunk properties. This was no longer the case in 1.0.0. In a Beta world, hostile mobs would spawn in light level 7 or lower while friendly mobs would spawn in light levels 9 or higher. Because of this, hostile mobs had a slight chance of spawning even though it was light due to them spawning in the air where there was little light. If you had a lot of torches down, go down to your mine, then return, you would have a tendency to find your house having some cows, pigs, chickens or sheep running about. \n \n \n [ edit ] Issues \n Issues relating to "Spawn" are maintained on Mojira. Report issues there. \n [ edit ] Other types of spawning \n A Monster Spawner causes mobs to spawn constantly in the area around it. \n A thrown chicken egg has a 1 in 8 chance of spawning a chicken , and an additional 1 in 32 chance of spawning 4 chickens from a single egg, so there is a total of 1 in 256 chance for a single thrown egg to spawn 4 chickens. \n Cows, chickens, pigs, sheep, mooshrooms, villagers, ocelots and wolves can breed. All of this requires a player to breed them except for villagers. \n Two snow blocks in the overworld placed on top of each other, with a pumpkin or Jack \'o\' Lantern , causes a Snow Golem to spawn. Likewise, replacing the Snow Blocks with iron blocks (with an extra one on opposite sides of the higher block) will cause an Iron Golem to spawn. Iron Golems can also spawn in villages (though the algorithm that causes this has not yet been determined). Withers can also be spawned by placing blocks. \n In Creative, the player can use Spawn Eggs to spawn most mobs. \n Siege : Zombies can spawn in villages. This is not natural spawning, as it can happen in mushroom biomes or if /gamerule doMobSpawning false is set. \n A Monster Egg will spawn a silverfish if broken, or if a nearby silverfish is attacked. \n A single Ender Dragon spawns in The End . \n Killing medium and large slimes and magma cubes will spawn more of them, but in a smaller size. \n Zombie Pigmen can spawn from nether portals. \n When a pig gets struck by lightning , it turns into a zombie pigman . \n [ edit ] Despawning \n \n \n \n  \nVarious mob spawning ranges, illustrated \n \n \n Monsters (not holding items or wearing armor) and squid (but not animals), including hostile wolves as of 1.1, can cease to exist, or "despawn", under certain conditions: \n \n A mob will immediately despawn if ever there is no player within 128 blocks of it. Note that this appears to be a sphere, not a cylinder from map top to bottom. \n A mob that has had no player within 32 blocks of it for more than 30 seconds has a 1 in 800 chance of despawning on each game tick (1/20th of a second). Therefore, the half-life of monsters not within 32 blocks of a player is 27.73 seconds, after the initial 30 seconds have elapsed. \n All hostile mobs (including those that are holding items) in a world will despawn if the difficulty is set to peaceful, regardless as to where the player is positioned in the world. \n \n In multiplayer, despawning does not occur while there are no players in the game. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Sometimes it is possible for the world spawn to be underground or in the ocean. \n World spawns can even be inside a dungeon.

Inside the cage there are flames that do not give off any light and a miniature spinning version of the mob that will spawn , which slowly increases speed until the next mob spawns. Spawners can spawn any mob. However, without the use of an inventory editor or custom map they only spawn zombies , skeletons , spiders , cave spiders , blazes , and silverfish . \n As of 12w22a, a mob spawner will drop 15-43 experience when broken. This means that it takes approx. 6 spawners to get to level 10, and a stack of spawners will get you from level 0 to 40. \n Players have designed many traps to kill mobs from spawners, employing a long fall , drowning , lava , cactus or a combination of these, which allow the player to collect item drops or experience in great numbers with little risk (see monster spawner traps .) \n The monster spawner is only available through use of the /give command and, if placed, will only spawn pigs by default. At this current time, even if correct data values for mobs are given when using the /give command , the mob spawner will always be a pig spawner. \n An interesting quirk of the monster spawner (and the end portal frame ) is that they are transparent in their rendering only - unlike all other transparent blocks, they can have torches and redstone placed on them, conduct a redstone current, will suffocate mobs, and more. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Occurrence \n 2 Spawning behavior \n \n 2.1 Detailed spawning algorithm \n \n \n 3 Custom Spawners \n 4 History \n 5 Issues \n 6 Trivia \n 7 Gallery \n 8 See also \n 9 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Occurrence \n \n \n \n  \nA monster spawner with a skeleton inside. \n \n \n Spawners can occur in these places, spawning mobs chosen randomly when generated: \n \n Dungeons \n Spawns Zombies (50% chance), Skeletons (25%), or Spiders (25%). One per dungeon. Sometimes a Spider Spawner will also spawn a Spider Jockey . \n Abandoned Mine Shafts \n Spawns Cave Spiders . Located in horizontal tunnels, heavily surrounded by Cobwebs . \n Strongholds \n Spawns Silverfish . Located in the End Portal room. One per stronghold. \n Nether Fortresses \n Spawns Blazes . Located on Nether fortress balconies with stairs leading up to them. \n \n Naturally occurring spawners will not spawn passive animals, Creepers , or Endermen . However, if a map editor or mod is used to create a spawner for any mob (although correct conditions must be upheld for the spawners to actually spawn a mob), it will function as expected (so it will even spawn Ender dragons ) \n There is no way to obtain a spawner in your inventory in Survival mode without turning on cheats, using mods with an inventory editor program, or using the "/give" operator command in a multiplayer server. It does not appear in the Creative mode inventory , but can be obtained using the pick block feature (before 1.2.5). If such a spawner is placed, or if a spawner is missing its tile entity data, it will spawn the same entity, but will have a pig inside. \n \n [ edit ] Spawning behavior \n A spawner will spawn mobs in the surrounding area, provided suitable spawning locations for the block \'s mob type can be found in the area. Spawning conditions vary from mob to mob. For example, Overworld monsters can only spawn in darkness ( light level 7 or below), and animals can only spawn with a light level 9 or above. Spawner blocks can spawn some mobs in mid- air , ignoring general rules about spawning on solid ground. Pigs, however, still require a grass block on which to spawn. \n A monster spawner is only active when a player is within a radius of 16 blocks from the spawner. While the block is active, it will spawn mobs within an 8 \xc3\x97 2 \xc3\x97 8 block volume (8 wide and 2 high and 8 long), centered on the corner of the spawner block with the lower x, y, and z-coordinates (i.e. the bottom northwestern corner). Mobs can spawn anywhere in this range that is suitable, even if the immediate vicinity of the spawner block itself is not suitable. The horizontal distribution is triangular, with positions near the spawner more likely than ones farther away. \n Note that while mobs are spawned at fractional x and z-coordinates (i.e. not aligned to blocks), they are spawned at an integer y-coordinate. Horizontally, a mob can spawn with its center point anywhere within the 8 \xc3\x97 8 range, but vertically, mobs will spawn with their legs at either the same layer as the spawner block, one block above it, or one block below it. Due to the y-coordinate ranging from -1 to 1 of the bottom surface of the spawner block, there are 3 vertical blocks of space in which mobs can spawn even though the spawning volume is only two blocks in height. This 3-block vertical space can be proven to exist with cave spider spawners and glass to limit the spawning space. \n For some types of mobs to spawn in the outer planes of the spawning volume, some planes outside the volume may also need to be free of opaque blocks to conform with the mobs\' height, width, or other rules governing their individual spawn volumes . For mobs that are two or more blocks tall such as zombies, skeletons, or blazes to spawn in the top y-layer, the layer above that must contain only air . \n \n Summary of maximum spawn volumes for common monster spawners \n \n Mob type \n Required Volume \n Failure rate from 8\xc3\x978\xc3\x974 volume [note 1] \n Vertical \nalignment \n \n \n   Pig \n 8.9 \xc3\x97 8.9 \xc3\x97 2.9 \n 2.531252% \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Cave Spider \n 8.7 \xc3\x97 8.7 \xc3\x97 2.5 \n 1.531252% \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Silverfish \n 8.3 \xc3\x97 8.3 \xc3\x97 2.7 \n 0.28125% \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Zombie \n   Skeleton \n   Blaze \n 8.6 x 8.6 x 3.8 \n 1.125% \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Spider \n 9.4 \xc3\x97 9.4 \xc3\x97 2.9 \n 6.125% \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n 8\xc3\x978\xc3\x973 is the actual volume across which spawners spawn entities, but this volume only contains the entity\'s center . The failure rate assumes 8\xc3\x978\xc3\x974 because it is a popular misconception that 8\xc3\x978\xc3\x974 is the maximum efficiency volume of empty space for mob spawners - it actually depends on the size of the entities themselves. Note that 10x10x4 is guaranteed to accommodate all of the above mobs. Also note that this failure rate only accounts for failures due to attempting to spawn a mob at the edges of the spawn range, not other causes of failure such as mobs attempting to spawn intersecting the spawner block itself. \n \n \n For all of the volumes listed in the table, the horizontal plane is centered on the northwestern corner of the spawner block. While the spawning volume for pigs is 8.9 \xc3\x97 8.9 \xc3\x97 2.9, the requirement of grass blocks that are necessary for pigs to spawn will reduce the actual volume in which they successfully spawn. \n The block will attempt to spawn 4 mobs at randomly chosen points within the spawning area, then wait anywhere from 200 to 799 ticks (10 to 39.95 seconds) before spawning again. As it waits, the mob inside the block will spin faster and faster. Except for spawning on a solid block, all of the usual requirements for spawning must be met (not in a solid block, correct light level, etc.), so the spawner will often produce fewer than 4 mobs. When it does spawn, it will "poof", and more lightless flames will temporarily appear around the Spawn block. If the block fails to spawn any mobs because it did not pick any suitable locations, it will repeat this process every tick until it succeeds. Only when it manages to spawn at least one mob will it start waiting for the next cycle. If, at the time of spawning, 6 or more monsters of the block\'s type are present within a 17 \xc3\x97 9 \xc3\x97 17 area (17 wide and 9 high and 17 long), centered on the spawner block, the spawner "poofs" without creating any monsters and then waits for the next cycle. However, if there are more of the mob outside of the specified range, then the monster spawner will continue spawning mobs indefinitely. \n In Peaceful difficulty , Monster Spawner blocks will still appear, but any spawned hostile mobs will disappear the instant they spawn. ( Zombie Pigmen , Magma Cubes , and Ghasts will not spawn at all.) This makes it easy to make the traps without being troubled by the mobs. The brief instant that the monster exists in the world before being removed is enough time for the player to be pushed around, for the sound file to play, and occasionally for Skeletons to fire arrows. \n [ edit ] Detailed spawning algorithm \n This pseudo-code is derived from the decompiled source of 1.4.2. \n \nevery spawn cycle (every randInt(200,799) ticks when a player is within\n 17 blocks of the spawner),\nloop 4 times {\n  if there are 6 or more of the mob type in the 17x9x17 area around the spawner,\n   skip this spawn cycle\n  calculate spawnerX = X coordinate of center of spawner - 0.5\n  calculate spawnerY = Y coordinate of center of spawner - 0.5\n  calculate spawnerZ = Z coordinate of center of spawner - 0.5\n  calculate x coordinate of mob = spawnerX + (randDouble() - randDouble()) * 4,\n   randDouble being a random number between 0 and 1\n  calculate y coordinate of mob = spawnerY + a random integer between -1 and 1\n  calculate z coordinate of mob = spawnerZ + (randDouble() - randDouble()) * 4,\n   randDouble being a random number between 0 and 1\n  if all of the conditions specific to the mob type are met, spawn the mob {\n   chicken, cow, mooshroom, pig, sheep, wolf:\n    block below spawning block is grass\n    spawning block has a light level of 9 or higher\n\n   ocelot:\n    pass a 2/3 random test\n    block below spawning block is grass or leaves\n    on layer 63 or higher\n\n   creeper, enderman, skeleton, spider, cave spider, zombie:\n    light level 7 or less\n\n   blaze:\n    light level 11 or less\n\n   silverfish:\n    light level 11 or less, or on Stone blocks\n    no players within 5 blocks\n\n   slime:\n    difficulty is not set to peaceful or slime size is small \n    either:\n      spawn block y coordinate is less than 40\n      the chunk containing the spawn block is a slime chunk (1 in 10 chance)\n      pass a 1 in 10 random test\n    or:\n      swamp biome, layer 51 through 69, light level 7 or less\n   \n   ghast:\n    pass a 1 in 20 random test\n   \n   squid:\n    must not collide with any other entities\n    must be in layer 46-62\n   \n   giant:\n    light level 7 or less\n    light level 8 or more\n    (since these conditions can\'t be true simultaneously, giant spawners don\'t work)\n   \n   all except squid and slimes:\n    must not collide with any blocks or other entities\n    must not collide with water or lava\n  }\n}\nif all 4 mobs failed to spawn, repeat on the next tick\n \n [ edit ] Custom Spawners \n Monster Spawners are capable of much more than they are used for in vanilla Minecraft. Using external tools such as inventory or map editors, they can be customized in many ways: \n \n They can be made to spawn any kind of entity, including any mob, items, minecarts, boats, falling blocks, primed TNT, and so on. \n A single spawner can spawn multiple different entities, chosen at random from a list. \n Properties can be set on the spawned entities, such as their location, velocity, inventory, potion effects, and much much more. \n Various range and timing properties of the spawner can be altered. \n \n Detailed technical information about custom spawners can be found in the chunk format reference. \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Infdev \n \n \n Seecret Friday Update 2 \n Added mob spawners. They could be picked up and when placed, spawned pigs . \n \n \n June 27, 2010 \n Mob spawners given a unique ID, reducing crashes. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n Beta \n Changed name from mob spawner to monster spawner. \n \n \n 1.2 \n Monster spawners again now show a rotating model inside of what they spawn in single player after being missing for several versions. \n \n \n 1.9pre1 \n Changed monster spawner texture to a darker color. \n \n \n 1.9pre4 \n It was possible to obtain a monster spawner using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. When placed they would only spawn pigs. \n \n \n Silk Touch became ineffective on spawners. \n \n \n 1.9pre5 \n Squid spawners now only work in a narrow elevation range, from 46 to 62. \n \n \n Monster Spawners no longer drop after destroyed. Even when you use a Silk Touch pickaxe, it will not drop. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0.0 \n Monster spawners are now easier to destroy. \n \n \n 1.2.1 \n 12w06a \n Monster spawners now show the mob they are spawning in multiplayer; previously it always showed a pig. \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w22a \n Monster spawners will now drop experience when destroyed. \n \n \n 12w26a \n Monster spawners now support extra data pertaining to what they spawn. For example, they can spawn Charged Creepers, Endermen holding specific blocks, previously unavailable Green Robe Villagers, and Villagers offering specific deals. They can also spawn non-mob entities, like specific dropped items, random fireworks, primed TNT, boats and minecarts. \n \n \n [ edit ] Issues \n Issues relating to "Monster Spawner" are maintained on Mojira. Report issues there. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n It is possible to choose which mob a spawner will spawn, but unless you know what each mob in its tile data is, this will be difficult. \n Since monster spawners are stored as tile entities, they cannot be pushed by pistons . \n It is possible for a monster spawner to occur near the surface and completely buried in sand , with monsters spawning in small gaps underneath sandstone . \n Unlike most other solid blocks, the monster spawner supports texture with transparent areas, without showing what\'s behind. \n It is possible for two monster spawners to naturally occur directly side-by-side. \n As of version 1.2.5, monster spawners are available in creative mode by using the Pick Block button on a natural generated monster spawner. When placed, they will spawn pigs if there is a grass block in the vicinity of the spawner. \n The traditional torch on the spawner may not be sufficient to completely disable it. Lighting the walls as well is safer. \n When mining near a monster spawner that has no valid places to spawn, sometimes a monster will spawn immediately after a block is mined. The player should take caution for this reason while collecting Moss Stone from a dungeon but hasn\'t destroyed the monster spawner. It\'s speculated this might happen because the spawner gets a chance to spawn before the lighting calculation for the space the block occupied. \n If a spawner is made to spawn a Giant, the mob still spins, but appears outside the spawner because of the mob\'s size. \n A monster spawner may spawn 1, 2, 3 or even 4 mobs at once [1] \n If the game is set on Peaceful, the mobs will spawn, but will immediately de-spawn, as usual. In some cases, mobs will play their sound file before they de-spawn. It is also possible for a skeleton to shoot its arrow at the player before it de-spawns. \n If the player is not within range, the miniature mob inside the spawner will stop spinning, and the mob spawner will stop emitting fire particles, along with not working all together. \n The miniature mob inside the mob spawner will spin faster when it is about to spawn monsters. There are set minimum and maximum speeds for which the miniature mob can rotate. \n Zombie Pigmen spawners cannot be disabled with light. They can spawn at any light level. \n As of 1.0.1, Monster Spawners now show a miniature figure of the mob they will spawn (Single Player only, Xbox 360 Edition). \n The miniature mob inside the monster spawner is an actual mob of that type. Thus, if a spawner is configured to spawn Ender Dragons or Withers , their boss health bar is visible while looking at the spawner. \n Mob spawners can be edited to spawn any entity. \n The spawn range, rate, location, and player detection range can be edited. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A blaze spawner in a nether fortress. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon , connected to another dungeon, with two spawners. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A Giant spawner \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A Ghast spawner \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A spawner edited to spawn zombies wearing enchanted diamond armor. \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Dungeon \n Monster Spawner Traps \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n [1] Video clearly showing two, three and four mobs spawning at the same time from a monster spawner. \n \n \n \n Blocks [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Blocks/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Monster_Spawner&amp;oldid=500035 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Blocks TileEntity Natural blocks  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t Portugu\xc3\xaas do Brasil \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 2 July 2013, at 01:23. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

For single-species farms built around a Monster Spawner , see Tutorials/Monster Spawner Traps . \n Mob Farms are structures built to acquire mob drops more easily and in larger numbers. They usually consist of two components, the farm itself, a large and dark room to spawn mobs and funnel them into a central location, and a Mob Grinder to kill them quickly and efficiently. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Locations \n 2 Drops \n 3 Designs \n \n 3.1 Sinkhole \n 3.2 Canal-Style \n \n 3.2.1 Compact Canal Design \n 3.2.2 Minimal Canal Design \n \n \n 3.3 Active Mob Displacement \n 3.4 Other Designs \n \n 3.4.1 One-Way Doors \n \n \n \n \n 4 Transporting Mobs \n \n 4.1 Horizontal Transportation \n 4.2 Downward transportation \n 4.3 Upward transportation \n \n \n 5 Grinding \n 6 Video \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Locations \n The purpose for the farm is to provide a large area that is a viable spawn position for the intended targets, and to kill the mobs quickly. Due to the rules Minecraft applies to spawning mobs, this makes the choice of a location for the mob farm a difficult topic. \n Farms placed on the surface can provide good drop rates during the day, when it is one of the few spots of dark ground, but has a sharp drop in effectiveness during nighttime, when the entire surface is dark enough to support mob spawning. \n Farms built underground have a time-independent drop rate, and will remain within your personal spawn range for hostiles when you go mining, but their effectiveness depends of the amount of unlit caverns in your vicinity, which provide alternative places for mobs to spawn. \n Farms floating high in the sky can achieve record spawn rates in both night and day, as they represent the only viable spawn ground. However, building one in survival is rather suicidal, and due to their height they will stop working completely when you descend undergroud to mine resources. To produce loot, you have to stay at the height of the farm. \n Superflat worlds will provide higher spawn rates than other worlds, as the missing air pockets underground reduce the amount of parasitic dark places. \n The Nether is difficult to farm, as water evaporates and all mobs are immune to fire. This reduces the amount of functioning farm designs considerably. Lava might be used for transport instead of water, but destroys the loot. One could try to funnel the mobs through Nether Portals to circumvent the restrictions. \n [ edit ] Drops \n What a mob farm produces depends on location and the type of grinder used to killing the mobs. Automatic killing will prevent rare drops and experience, but is safer as the player is not required to be near the mobs. Following is a table with mobs that can be effectively farmed and their usual and player-caused drops. Player caused drops, as well as experience, can only be obtained when the monster is killed manually. \n \n \n Mob \n Normal Drops \n Player\xe2\x80\x93Caused Drops \n Notes \n \n \n   Creeper \n   Gunpowder \n None \n \n \n \n   Enderman \n   Ender Pearl \n None \n Does not work with water-based farms.

If you plan to be directly beneath the center of the farm, waiting for the items, the radius in which mobs would spawn can be easily used to calculate the size of the farm: \n \n floor ( sqrt ( 1024 - (Spawn Floor Height - Collection Floor Height)^2 )) = Spawn Room Radius \n \n If you plan to spend your time in a less defined position, it might be easier to stack a simple design several times, ensuring that at least some areas are in the spawn range while limiting complexity. \n [ edit ] Sinkhole \n The easiest possible design consists of a large, empty area of simple shape, with one or more holes in the ground for the mobs to drop through. The edge of each hole has to be lined with signs or opened trapdoors to trick the Mob AI into believing the hole to be solid ground. With approximately 0.542 wood per sign, they are the more economic choice over the trapdoors at 0.75 wood each. However, trapdoors can be controlled with Redstone, so one could shut off the farm by closing the holes remotely. \n The whole room is closed by a roof to create minimal light level. A roof height of 3 allows Endermen to spawn, while a roof height of 1 would restrict the farm to spiders. \n Sinkhole farms are naturally not very effective, as the chance for a mob to wander into a hole is small, and zero when the player is so far away that the mobs freeze. But they can be built quickly and cheaply and will work in the Nether as well. \n [ edit ] Canal-Style \n \n \n \n  \nExample layout of a 38x38 Canal-Style farm \n \n \n To improve the chances of a mob falling into the holes, one can add channels filled with flowing water, leading to the central hole. The channels are lined with signs to trick the mobs into falling in, and the water transports them into the grinders. Such a design requires a bit of planning to ensure that there is no stationary water in which the mobs might get stuck, reducing effectiveness. \n Since the system uses water to transport mobs, it will fail to capture Endermen, which teleport away when touching water. Therefore, the roof of the cavern should be 2 blocks above the ground to prevent griefing of your farm by Endermen taking blocks. \n [ edit ] Compact Canal Design \n \n \n \n  \nCompact Canal design \n \n \n A very easily built design can be made in an 18x18 area, using eight water source blocks to fill the channels, which are exactly eight blocks long so that the water stops exactly at the edges of the central hole. The design can be easily stacked or placed next to each other to increase the effectiveness. \n [ edit ] Minimal Canal Design \n \n \n \n  \nMinimal Canal design, using glass to show the flow of water \n \n \n If there is not enough space for larger designs, this might be used. Its small size of 10x10 (inner area) makes it able to be incorporated into larger construction projects without trouble. It uses four water source blocks, one in each corner, with the water flowing around 3x3 squares of building material to the central hole. The parts of the water between the wall and the blocks is closed over to provide more spawning area. \n [ edit ] Active Mob Displacement \n The Canal-Style System still suffer from the mobs freezing when outside a certain range around your character. Active Systems can correct that problem, using Redstone and Dispensers filled with a Water bucket to flood the spawning grounds repeatedly, flushing all mobs into the channels to be transported to the grinders. Thus, the farm provides area for the mobs to spawn in, but does not rely on mob movement to get them into the grinder. Using this, one can omit the signs needed for the other, passive designs. \n A good example of this kind of farm can be seen here, stacking the same basic design several times and using fall damage as grinder. \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Other Designs \n Instead of using water to transport mobs, there are various other methods to make them move towards the grinder, all of which may work better with certain mobs, but can have higher resource requirements or lesser gathering rates. \n [ edit ] One-Way Doors \n Relying on the random movement of mobs, One-Way Door Designs prevent the mobs from wandering backwards by using doors or pistons. Making several sets of doors can increase the speed with which the mobs move towards the hole. \n The easiest configuration consists of a wall of doors (Iron on Hard difficulty to prevent Zombies from smashing them, Wood on other difficulties) with a row of pressure plates in front of them. When the mobs walk onto the pressure plates, the door opens, letting them through, but once on the other side, they can\'t open the door since there is no switch. \n With Pistons, the arrangement is reversed, with the pressure plates on the desired side, and the pistons pointing upwards, so that they block the path of the mobs when extended. This design only work with a 2-block high roof to prevent the mobs from jumping, and even then might fail on spiders. However, it requires considerably more common ingredients than the iron door variant. \n Such systems can also be used to "store" mobs after gathering them from the farm, so that they later can be killed for the rare drops and experience. \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Transporting Mobs \n After collecting the mobs from the farm, it might be beneficial to transport them to a different location before grinding them , so that you can access the items more easily while remaining at a close-to optimal position for the spawning of your farms. \n [ edit ] Horizontal Transportation \n Horizontal Transportation can be done easily using flowing water, with a drop of 1 block vertically for every 8 block travelled horizontally. Build a tunnel with a height of 3 blocks and a width equal to the size of your gathering holes (usually 2). Mine forward to a length of 8 Blocks, so that water placed at the start ends exactly at the drop. Repeat, but one block lower, so that the creeps fall from one funnel part to the next. Mine out the roof at the higher level for 2 or 3 more block to prevent spider clinging to the walls from clogging up the funnel. \n \n \n \n  \nSpider grinder \n \n \n Alternatively, one can use a cactus to grind the spiders immediately. To do this, make the first funnel part only 7 block long and place only one water source block instead of two. Place a sand block and a cactus on top on the same side as the source block. The place the cactus, you have to mine out the block next to it. To ensure the water flow on the next part, mine out the wall block next to the sand and add the water sources there and next to the sand, where there would usually be one. \n [ edit ] Downward transportation \n Transporting mobs and items downward is trivial, simply let them drop down a chute with a water brake at the bottom. Or omit the water brake when you want the mobs to die from fall damage. \n [ edit ] Upward transportation \n Upward transportation uses the fact that nearly all mobs will attempt to swim in water, moving upwards. Therefore, to get the mobs using upwards, one has to provide only a column of water with enough air holes to prevent them from drowning. This can be done by arranging signs or ladders and water source blocks in the following vertical configuration: \n   \n   \n This can be repeated indefinitely in any direction for a mob elevator. When arriving at the right height, flowing water on top of the topmost ladder in enough to dislodge them. \n However, one should remember that Slimes do not swim, and neither do Items. These things will instead float downwards to the bottom, which can be used to separate items or Slimes from other mobs. \n [ edit ] Grinding \n \n Main article: Tutorials/Mob Grinder \n \n The last part of a mob farm is to kill the gathered mobs and collect their items. This can be done in different ways, using the variety of damage available in Minecraft, like falling, suffocating, drowing, burning, sunlight (for undead), touching cacti or simply player-applied damage from weapons. \n Passive Systems do not change to kill the mobs, they rely on constantly available damage sources . The most common mob grinders, the "Lava Blade" and "Drowning Trap" fall in this category. \n Active Systems have to change configuration to actually kill mobs, usually in the form of redstone devices. The most known might be the "Piston Grinder", which applies suffocation damage by pushing an opaque block into the head of the mob. While possibly faster than passive systems in killing, active systems usually have a limited capacity, and higher amounts of mobs might clog or even jam the system. \n EXP farms are systems that capture and soften up the mobs, but rely on the player to deliver the killing blow, so that the rare drops and experience can be gathered. An example would be a nearly-lethal falling height which would reduce the majority of mobs to half a heart, easily killed even without a weapon. However, such systems are only as good as the player using them, and in constant danger of being destroyed by creepers if not built out of obsidian. \n With the Hopper , it becomes easy to collect the dropped items, even without player interference. This makes fully automatic mob farms possible where the loot will be deposited in a chest for easy accessibility. \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n \n \n Tutorials \n \n \n Introductory \n \n \n Your

They employ the mob spawners found in dungeons as a source of mobs . The purpose of these traps is to create an infinite source of items which can be gathered in an efficient way from the mobs spawned by the monster spawner. Two general goals of these traps are to keep the player safe and to allow the mobs to spawn. \n See Also: Tutorials/Mob Farm , for systems based on naturally spawning a mixture of monsters. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Finding the dungeon \n 2 Simple Farms \n 3 Killing Mechanism \n \n 3.1 Lava Blade Traps \n 3.2 Drowning Traps \n 3.3 Flow Trap \n 3.4 Sunlight Based Traps \n 3.5 Potion-Based Trap \n 3.6 Iron Golem traps \n 3.7 Cactus Traps \n 3.8 Villager Traps \n 3.9 Blaze Traps \n 3.10 A Note on Lava \n \n \n 4 Auto Meat Cooking Trap \n 5 Other \n \n 5.1 Pit Trap \n 5.2 Experience Trap \n 5.3 Efficient Pit + Experience Trap w/ TuT (by Epiiik) \n \n 5.3.1 Alternative Layout \n \n \n 5.4 Another Experience Trap (by AlexxShadenk777) \n 5.5 Humanoid Monster Spawner Xp Trap(By HeofShadow) \n \n \n 6 Multiple spawners of the same species \n 7 Videos \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Finding the dungeon \n Dungeons are found when exploring caves and Abandoned Mine Shafts . They appear to spawn in random places, but almost always underground. Third-Party programs / mods / texture packs , such as a map viewer, can help the player locate a dungeon. \n Mob Spawners can be neutralized by placing torches to light up any dark areas around the spawner. Because blazes can spawn in light level 11 or below, however, torches (light level 14) are not very effective for neutralizing blaze spawners. As of Version 1.5.2, there are six types of mobs that can spawn broken into two categories, tall mobs (blaze, skeleton and zombie); and short mobs (standard spiders, cave spiders, and silverfish). \n In the nether , Blaze spawners can be generated in Nether Fortresses , and can be trapped to collect Blaze Rods . Blaze spawners are the most dangerous to trap, for fear of the blazes, and lava in the nether. Frequent death will happen unless you have strong armour or set the difficulty to peaceful. \n Silverfish spawners can be found in the portal room of a Stronghold . However, Silverfish do not drop anything and are bothersome unless properly trapped. You may choose to simply break the spawner, unless you want to create a silverfish trap near an entrance to your base. Silverfish do have some advantages, as they are the easiest hostile mob to kill and produce an average amount of xp. \n The most dangerous spawner in the upper world are those of skeletons, due to their long range capability, and (since the pretty scary update) shoot very fast when in close proximity of the player. As such it is advisable to plan ahead before assaulting one of these spawners. \n Normal spider spawners are one of the easiest to trap, as they can not fit through a 1 wide hole, so you can dig through the side and place a torch on the spawner without fear of getting hurt. \n Cave spider spawners are hard to trap, and since you will get poisoned on normal difficulty, it is advisable to break these as soon as possible. However, cave spiders can fit through 1x1 block spaces, which makes building a trap easier if you know how, and the spawners are generated far more often then other types. Some even can generate within 20 blocks of another, which can be made into a very efficient trap. \n [ edit ] Simple Farms \n The three most common types of spawner are for zombies , skeletons , and spiders . In each case, it\'s fairly trivial to set them up so that you can attack the monsters without retaliation, forming a simple farm for XP and their drops. (Sometimes cave spider spawners can be treated similarly, but this is more hazardous.) Proceed as follows: \n \n Secure and light the area around the dungeon! Light the room and spawner while you work on it, so the monsters don\'t interrupt you. \n Ransack and clear out the chests. Choose and prepare a "front" area for the farm, with a chest and crafting table to supply stone swords for cheap slaughter. Make sure you have a clear approach and/or room to back away quickly, in case you come by and find one or more creepers spawned inside, and you need to shoot them. \n Prepare the spawner area, and especially, open up the entire spawning range: Horizontally, that\'s 8\xc3\x978, from the northwestern-corner of the spawner. That range also includes a block above and below the spawner, so take up the original cobblestone and moss-stone floor, if necessary supplying a new floor one level below. Extend the front to match, so you don\'t have monsters or items hiding in corners. \n Now seal off extra exits and alcoves, fill stray holes, and place fences or other barriers to channel mobs toward the front. If you want any redstone circuits, now is the time to set up the alcoves and access tunnels. \n Optionally, set up redstone systems:\n \n Most important is a flood system, to wash monsters and stray drops toward the front. If you\'ve opened up the full 8\xc3\x978 area under the spawner, you can get a nice sheet of water from three dispensers at the back, each containing a water bucket. This will push monsters forward and bring all drops within reach of the front. If you still have items being stuck in one corner, you might resort to a side tunnel and a sticky piston to get at them without exposing yourself. \n If you\'re ambitious, you can build a system to light up the dungeon when desired. This will be much easier if you have redstone lamps . \n \n \n Prepare the front according to the monster type. You will always want fence gates, in case you want to dash in between spawns to collect drops, or to fix something up.\n \n For zombies, a simple gated fence will do. Maximize your view of the spawner, so that they come to the fence quickly. \n For spiders, you want one or more 1-block wide slits, 2 or 3 blocks high. You can attack them, they can\'t come through. To defend against creepers and other non-spider spawns, you can make these slits two-high, between top and bottom slabs . (That is, three blocks total, but with the top and bottom spaces half-blocked by slabs.) The "tall" monsters will not recognize these as passable, but you can move or attack through them easily. \n For cave spiders (if you must), you can place a door between floor-to-ceiling fences (see pictures below). Iron doors are better, so that you can\'t accidentally open it while you\'re whacking at the spiders.\n \n Note that cave spider spawners don\'t come pre-enclosed in a dungeon, so you\'ll likely need to start by building a room around them. Remember that the spiders can appear up to 4 blocks away (depending on direction) from the spawner, whether or not there\'s a wall in the way. \n \n \n Skeletons are trickiest: They can shoot through even brief gaps, the moment they get the angle. For the actual killing zone, you want fences/gates at eye level (so they can\'t shoot you), with an open row below (so you can attack). If you stand directly in front of the fence, they will usually come up to the front so you can attack them. That row in front of the fence can also be a trench -- you can reach further into the room, but then they will occasionally get an arrow or two under the fences. \n \n \n Once your farm is prepared, remove most or all of the lights. Beat a hasty retreat to the front.\n \n Special case: If you found a dungeon in a Mushroom Biome, congratulations! Since creepers can\'t spawn, you can pull out all the lights in the dungeon room, and get maximum output from the spawner. \n \n \n Make some stone swords and whack away. Keep bow and arrows handy near the entrance, in case a creeper spawns while you\'re away or approaching, or otherwise sneaks into the room. (Normal darkness spawns are suppressed within 24 blocks of a player.) \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A classic water floor for normal dungeons \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Redstone lamps controlling a spawner \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Containing cave spiders \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A more elaborate farm, using water to wash them forward \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Killing Mechanism \n Any standard mob grinder can be connected to a dungeon. However, the purpose of this device is for players who are currently low on materials and can\'t yet build something larger . As of version 1.5, a hopper can be used to collect the items into a chest. \n [ edit ] Lava Blade Traps \n A lava blade trap consists of using water underneath the spawner and funneling these into a single line. At this point the mob should find themselves approaching a sign at ground level and a \'lava blade\' above it which flows over the top of the sign but no further. This allows the mob to drop items at their feet for your collection. A tutorial can be found here . \n [ edit ] Drowning Traps \n Drowning traps employ water to drown the hostile mobs. Mobs float in water and items drop, which allows easy separation. In this example, the dungeon is a 5x5 zombie spawner. \n \n Capture the spawner and place water in one of the corners. The opposite corner should have one dry block. \n Dig a small hole in the dry corner. This is where the items will drop and a water channel is recommended. \n Place two signs in the corners and one in the hole. Water considers signs to be solid blocks. \n When water is placed in the corner, it will be held in place, even though it will look like it is flowing backwards. \n Place glass panes (any block works, but this is a cheap material and allows easy access while filling up the drowning chamber). \n Fill the chamber with water to the ceiling. \n Close up the chamber. \n Place a collection stream below the drowning chamber. Remove the torches and close up the dungeon walls. \n \n Take out the torches and enclose the dungeon. This was designed for tall mobs, but can be modified for spiders by making the drowning chamber larger. Use signs to hold up water. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Capture spawner \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Place water in one corner.

It\'s effective and safe on all mobs, except blazes, since you need water. Disable the spawner, and then make an 8x8 room around the spawner. On one side, place water on every other block. On the opposite side, make a one block deep trench extending along the side opposite the water. Light up the trench well. If you want, you can add a pool for fish and get a fishing rod to fish. Then, make a wall with a line of air at eye level to look through and strike. The holes have to be next to water. Now, get plenty of food, a few chests, and two or three swords. Now, remove the torches and let mobs spawn. The water will bring them and the drops to you, and and you can shoot them and hit them. Also, make a room to eat and heal in safety, just in case you didn\'t build the trap thouroghly. With this trap, You can go for hours in one go, and gain hundreds of experience levels and items at minimum risk. The trap system is built in a way where you can easily leave when you want, with almost no creepers or non-spawner mobs popping up. \n \n If the spawner is a spider, make these adjustments:\n \n Add iron doors with levers to control mob flooding and possible death. \n Bring milk.\n \n This precaution is for cave spiders. \n \n \n Add an on/off lighting system. \n Bring bows to help control mob flooding and possible death. \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Sunlight Based Traps \n This type only applies to zombie and skeleton mob spawners. Where below a spawner has water flowing from one side to another side where precisely at the end the water stops, the pit drops down a level or two and directly above this dry area is a skylight to the surface which will burn the mobs alive. An example of this can be found here . \n [ edit ] Potion-Based Trap \n This is a fairly expensive and hard to make trap, so it\'s not recommended. \n First: Light up the room to prevent mobs from spawning. \n Second: On top, dig out 2 blocks from the spawner room top without breaking the spawner roof \n Third: Place the wires and dispensers like shown: \n \nDWWWWWD X - Roof Block\nXXXWXXX W - Wires\nXXXWXXX D - Dispenser looking in the spawner room\nXXXLXXX L - Lever, button or even a redstone clock, whatever you want to power \nXXXWXXX  the dispensers up!\nXXXWXXX\nDWWWWWD \n \n Fourth: Put inside the dispensers: \n HARMING POTIONS: Used to damage Spiders. HEALING POTIONS: Used to damage Skeletons and Zombies. POISON POTIONS: Used to weaken all enemies, best if you want to gather XP with fists. \n Fifth and last, but not least: Take the lights out, get up, and when you hear the roars, push the lever/activate clock/ whatever you used to power it up. \n Again, it\'s expensive, so it\'s a lot better to use water or lava traps until you got a blaze trap, a lot of patience and potions, or just playing Creative/Having TooManyItems. \n [ edit ] Iron Golem traps \n In this trap an Iron Golem is used to kill the monsters for you. To make it, simply make an Iron Golem in the dungeon and watch it kill for you. However, the Iron Golem will eventually die (especially if more than 1 enemy is spawned), so you\'ll have to replace it with another. Another farm using Iron Golems is a house with 15 NPC villagers in it (houses with 15 villagers spawn Iron Golems) and have a killing mechanism to get free iron, it should only have one door because the golems only spawn at the door, and knowing where they will spawn. Lava traps are ideal as they will drop the items at the golem\'s feet where you can put signs and have a water channel to collect the drops. \n [ edit ] Cactus Traps \n The following cactus trap is designed for spiders. It has a chance of destroying the items, but this is an inherent issue with cacti. (This can also incorporate a small cactus farm by placing a block 2 blocks above the cacti.) \n \n Dig the main channel. The spider spawner is left in the wall forcing spiders to spawn on the small dry patch. \n Dig two blocks down and one block in just before the cacti. These two holes will hold the collection water sources. \n Place three ladders on the far side of the collection output. Place one on either piece of sand. Place the two water sources in the holes. \n Place the main water in the two openings. The block between them makes the water flow towards the gap in the cacti, slightly improving the collection rate of string. \n Cover the entire trap and remove all lights. \n \n [ edit ] Villager Traps \n \n First make a room high above the ground and move at least 2 villagers to it. \n Now put at least nine doors in it. \n Next change one of the one wall in the room to glass. \n Attach another room to the side that the glass wall is on. \n Mine a hole in the floor of the empty room. \n Line the hole with open trap doors (if your hole is 2 by 2 you will need 4 trap doors) \n Directly under the hole, make a room without a roof on the ground. \n This trap only works with zombies \n Both rooms that are in the sky must be very dark \n The zombies will try to get the villagers, they will fall through the hole, and if the room was high enough kill themselves in doing so and drop some awesome stuff! \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Main channel, dry \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Collection channel, dry \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Collection channel, water and ladder placement \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Main channel, water flow \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Both channels. Front view. \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Blaze Traps \n Since it is impossible to obtain water in the Nether for a drowning trap, this trap takes advantage of Blazes\' weakness to snowballs . To create this trap, one must disable the Blaze Spawner and fence a Snow Golem into a nook in a wall. Once the spawner is re-enabled, the Snow Golem will shoot snowballs at the Blaze until it dies. Alternately, one may create a redstone mechanism that brings out Glowstone or turns on redstone lights to prevent the Blazes from spawning until the mechanism is switched. Fenced access to a Snow Golem\'s nook can allow the player to construct a new one should the Blaze defeat it. However, in Minecraft version 1.2, Snow Golems die in the Nether, making this trap need a potion of fire resistance. \n Another way to make a blaze farm is to box in the spawner so that the blazes can\'t fly away. leave a space at the blazes foot level and stand so that your eye level is at that space. That way the blazes can\'t hit you (mostly) but you can hit them. This is also a pretty good experience farm since each blaze is worth 10 xp. Be warned however that sometimes blazes will spawn outside the box so it is advised that one box themselves in as well. \n [ edit ] A Note on Lava \n Lava can quickly kill mobs and can be suspended on either a ladder or a sign. To suspend the lava, create a 3-long channel then put a sign or ladder on the last block. Lava spreads three blocks away from the source, so the last section of the lava will be left suspended on the sign or ladder. \n Lava generates light, which can lower the spawn rate in the dungeon unless placed far away; however the increased turnover of mobs may compensate for this. (Only one trial - lava \'blade\' is approximately 7 blocks away from spawner. Significantly increased rate with lava closer as opposed to having a dark spawn room with lava further away.) \n Here [1] is a video example of how to make a dungeon trap using a lava grinder in 1.2.5. \n [ edit ] Auto Meat Cooking Trap \n This is when you have peaceful mobs spawn and are burned to death which cooks the dropped meat. First you cause peaceful animal mobs to spawn. Then you cause them to fall into lava that is one block high with a sign below it. This prevents the lava from flowing. Below the signs you put a block of cobweb. This causes mobs that have been caught on fire by the fire to burn and die without losing the drops. Just have a way to collect the fallen meat, and you have an Auto Meat Cooker. You can also make a chicken trap by making a big pit of fire and then go high up and put a spawner. The chickens will fall into the fire and drop cooked chicken. \n \n \n \n  \nA working Auto-Pork Cooker \n \n \n [ edit ] Other \n Traps that use unusual methods, such as huge pits, fall into this category. \n Note : Using a half slab of cobble, planks, or sandstone in murder holes will prevent creepers and skeletons from seeing you, then you can retrieve items without breaking blocks, place the half slab on top of where the mobs would usually stand. \n [ edit ] Pit Trap \n \n For this method, you must dig a pit that reaches far under the dungeon. Depending on the height (at least 23 blocks), the mob will die on impact, as long as there isn\'t 2+ blocks of water at the bottom. However, this method takes a long time to make and only works for spawners near or above the surface. Alternatively, you can build an elevator for the mobs using alternating water and signs to bring the mobs 23 or more blocks higher , and then drop them 23 or more blocks in order to kill them (or you can do 22 blocks if being used for an XP farm). \n \n [ edit ] Experience Trap \n \n For this trap, you need to dig a large pit 22 blocks deep under the dungeon, or make a water elevator taking them upwards so you can stay near the monster spawner. Go to the bottom of the pit and place water in a fashion so that it should flow towards a wall. Then make a room where the water is flowing . This is where you will stay while finishing off the mobs. Make the room so that it has a one-block hole where you can see the mob drop zone . Hopefully, mobs should spawn, fall down the pit and survive with half a heart, get pushed towards you by the water current, and get killed by a single hit. If you like, you can bring food along as your hunger will deplete over time. This should provide normal as well as rare mob drops and experience levels, making it quite useful. Another technique is to leave your player by the dungeon for a couple of hours, overnight is suggested, and there will be at least a hundred monsters waiting to be harvested. There is a possibility of the number of monsters glitching your minecraft, and maybe even crashing on weaker computers. \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Efficient Pit + Experience Trap w/ TuT (by Epiiik) \n  \n \n *Note, all dimensions are given the format: Horizontal x Vertical. This method is an indirect hybrid of the aforementioned traps, utilizing both fall damage and mob control with water. In the mob spawning room, dig 1 block down so that the spawner is at eye level, and place water blocks at two adjacent corners. On the wall opposite of the two water blocks, dig a 1 x 2 hole for three blocks in the middle of the wall (allowing mobs to pass through). \n \n \n Begin digging upwards in a 1 x 2 fashion for 26 blocks. To get up, place signs on the long-faced wall (your left/right) in a zig-zag pattern going up while placing water blocks in between the signs. The first sign should be placed as furthest, lowest space possible. Stop placing signs after the 23rd level. The last water block should be against the wall furthest away from the mob spawner on the 24th level. \n \n \n On the 25-24 block levels, dig a 1 x 2 hole for seven blocks in the direction the mob spawner. On the seventh block in, dig one block downwards. Dig in the forward direction for eight more blocks (again, 1 x 2). You should notice the water block placed on the 24th level should stop where the path drops by one block. Place a water block against the wall of the drop. Notice how this water block stops 1 block short of the path. \n \n \n Dig further for two block and begin to dig downwards in a 1 x 1 fashion for 22 blocks. Face the direction of the mob spawner and dig another 1 x 2 hole one block deep. Dig down one and fill the top level with one block so that you can only see through one block of the pit you just created. (If you are using a skeleton spawner, you will need to stand one block away from this hole so that the skeletons cannot shoot you.) You are now standing at the loot point. Now that the almost-dead mobs are depositing into your 1 x 1 hole, simply attack them with any item to gain their loot and experience! You may use TNT + water to do splash damage to kill all mobs at once at the risk of lag spikes. Splash potions of Healing will also work, as they do damage to most hostile mobs. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Alternative Layout \n \n An alternative layout with a smaller footprint takes advantage of the fact that a player must be within 16 blocks of a spawner for it to activate, but that spawners only check 9 blocks vertically for spawned mobs. Build the trap as above, except instead of being off to the side, the killing floor is 4-16 squares directly above the monster spawner. This requires less materials, less x,z space and less precision in construction, though is 3-15 blocks taller. \n \n \n To construct the trap this way, build a 9x5x9 room around the monster spawner with flowing water leading the mobs into a corner. Build a water ladder in this corner going 26-38 blocks upwards as measured from the top of the monster spawner. At the top of the ladder, direct the mobs a couple blocks in any direction with water, and into a 22 block drop chute. At the bottom of the drop chute, create a platform 1 block lower, with a 1x1 "window" into the chute through which you can strike the mobs safely from the platform. \n \n [ edit ] Another Experience Trap (by AlexxShadenk777) \n \n Firstly it should be noted that this was made with a Zombie spawner in mind. Basically you just make a balcony of sorts and wail on the zombies as they approach you while being unable to hit you. \n Seal the zombie spawner in a 5x5x5 chamber, naturally you want it to stay in the center of the chamber at the lowest height. Outside of the chamber make a platform that is 2 blocks high that surrounds the outer wall, and while standing on this platform, punch a wide hole in the corner of the chamber 1 block above the platform. Remove the corner block so you can stand in the corner while the zombies practically funnel toward you. They\'ll be able to push you but not hit you at all, so you\'re free to smack them on the head with your weapon of choice. \n Naturally the rotten meat they drop will remain inside the chamber but the experience points will hover toward you. If for some reason the points end up too far just walk around the chamber to their nearest corner. \n Optional: lead some tamed wolves into the chamber before sealing it! \n \n [ edit ] Humanoid Monster Spawner Xp Trap(By HeofShadow) \n This type of Spawner is made for Humanoid type Monster Spawners(Skeletons, Zombies, and in some cases Zombie Pigmen), but can be modified for a Spider Spawner. First disable the Monster Spawner and areas around it with Torches so Mobs do not spawn and disrupt the creation of the trap. Now make a room 17 blocks wide by 9 blocks long and anywhere from 4-7 blocks high, with the Spawner being in the rough center and 1-2 blocks above the ground. Now dig out the bottom row 1 down everywhere except the center, which should be dug down around 7 blocks. Place A water Source Block on each end of this dug out area and it should stop just before the center. Now place Water Source Blocks at the top so that it should stop before running into the dug out area. Remove the Torches so that the Mobs start spawning, and go down so that you are at eye level with where the center area was dug down 7 blocks. Make it so you can only see the Mobs feet on one side, and on the other use a slab to make it so you can just see the top of it\'s head. This allows good use of both Swords And Bows(Also, some servers give bonus damage for Headshots). *Screenshots Coming Soon* \n [ edit ] Multiple spawners of the same species \n To maintain maximum efficiency a trap must take on an increased complexity in keeping mobs separated or moving quickly when dealing with multiple spawners of the same species. Minecraft first checks within the 17 wide by 17 long by 9 high area with the spawner in the center (or 8x8x4 radius from the spawner) for mobs of the same species as the spawner. If there are fewer than 6 mobs of the same species in the checking zone, it will spawn a mob within half the distance of the checking radius. This means that with two spawners of the same species near to each other, there will be a zone that mobs will count for both spawners and severely impact the spawn rates. It would be a wise idea to work out where these checking zones overlap and ensure that mobs being funneled to the trap do not enter that zone and/or leave the overlapped / checking area as quickly as possible to maintain peak monster spawner output. \n [ edit ] Videos \n \n EXP farm with Monster spawner Tutorial \n Simple Mob Trap \n \n This design is easy to build and doesn\'t require too many materials.

Inside the cage there are flames that do not give off any light and a miniature spinning version of the mob that will spawn , which slowly increases speed until the next mob spawns. Spawners can spawn any mob. However, without the use of an inventory editor or custom map they only spawn zombies , skeletons , spiders , cave spiders , blazes , and silverfish . \n As of 12w22a, a mob spawner will drop 15-43 experience when broken. This means that it takes approx. 6 spawners to get to level 10, and a stack of spawners will get you from level 0 to 40. \n Players have designed many traps to kill mobs from spawners, employing a long fall , drowning , lava , cactus or a combination of these, which allow the player to collect item drops or experience in great numbers with little risk (see monster spawner traps .) \n The monster spawner is only available through use of the /give command and, if placed, will only spawn pigs by default. At this current time, even if correct data values for mobs are given when using the /give command , the mob spawner will always be a pig spawner. \n An interesting quirk of the monster spawner (and the end portal frame ) is that they are transparent in their rendering only - unlike all other transparent blocks, they can have torches and redstone placed on them, conduct a redstone current, will suffocate mobs, and more. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Occurrence \n 2 Spawning behavior \n \n 2.1 Detailed spawning algorithm \n \n \n 3 Custom Spawners \n 4 History \n 5 Issues \n 6 Trivia \n 7 Gallery \n 8 See also \n 9 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Occurrence \n \n \n \n  \nA monster spawner with a skeleton inside. \n \n \n Spawners can occur in these places, spawning mobs chosen randomly when generated: \n \n Dungeons \n Spawns Zombies (50% chance), Skeletons (25%), or Spiders (25%). One per dungeon. Sometimes a Spider Spawner will also spawn a Spider Jockey . \n Abandoned Mine Shafts \n Spawns Cave Spiders . Located in horizontal tunnels, heavily surrounded by Cobwebs . \n Strongholds \n Spawns Silverfish . Located in the End Portal room. One per stronghold. \n Nether Fortresses \n Spawns Blazes . Located on Nether fortress balconies with stairs leading up to them. \n \n Naturally occurring spawners will not spawn passive animals, Creepers , or Endermen . However, if a map editor or mod is used to create a spawner for any mob (although correct conditions must be upheld for the spawners to actually spawn a mob), it will function as expected (so it will even spawn Ender dragons ) \n There is no way to obtain a spawner in your inventory in Survival mode without turning on cheats, using mods with an inventory editor program, or using the "/give" operator command in a multiplayer server. It does not appear in the Creative mode inventory , but can be obtained using the pick block feature (before 1.2.5). If such a spawner is placed, or if a spawner is missing its tile entity data, it will spawn the same entity, but will have a pig inside. \n \n [ edit ] Spawning behavior \n A spawner will spawn mobs in the surrounding area, provided suitable spawning locations for the block \'s mob type can be found in the area. Spawning conditions vary from mob to mob. For example, Overworld monsters can only spawn in darkness ( light level 7 or below), and animals can only spawn with a light level 9 or above. Spawner blocks can spawn some mobs in mid- air , ignoring general rules about spawning on solid ground. Pigs, however, still require a grass block on which to spawn. \n A monster spawner is only active when a player is within a radius of 16 blocks from the spawner. While the block is active, it will spawn mobs within an 8 \xc3\x97 2 \xc3\x97 8 block volume (8 wide and 2 high and 8 long), centered on the corner of the spawner block with the lower x, y, and z-coordinates (i.e. the bottom northwestern corner). Mobs can spawn anywhere in this range that is suitable, even if the immediate vicinity of the spawner block itself is not suitable. The horizontal distribution is triangular, with positions near the spawner more likely than ones farther away. \n Note that while mobs are spawned at fractional x and z-coordinates (i.e. not aligned to blocks), they are spawned at an integer y-coordinate. Horizontally, a mob can spawn with its center point anywhere within the 8 \xc3\x97 8 range, but vertically, mobs will spawn with their legs at either the same layer as the spawner block, one block above it, or one block below it. Due to the y-coordinate ranging from -1 to 1 of the bottom surface of the spawner block, there are 3 vertical blocks of space in which mobs can spawn even though the spawning volume is only two blocks in height. This 3-block vertical space can be proven to exist with cave spider spawners and glass to limit the spawning space. \n For some types of mobs to spawn in the outer planes of the spawning volume, some planes outside the volume may also need to be free of opaque blocks to conform with the mobs\' height, width, or other rules governing their individual spawn volumes . For mobs that are two or more blocks tall such as zombies, skeletons, or blazes to spawn in the top y-layer, the layer above that must contain only air . \n \n Summary of maximum spawn volumes for common monster spawners \n \n Mob type \n Required Volume \n Failure rate from 8\xc3\x978\xc3\x974 volume [note 1] \n Vertical \nalignment \n \n \n   Pig \n 8.9 \xc3\x97 8.9 \xc3\x97 2.9 \n 2.531252% \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Cave Spider \n 8.7 \xc3\x97 8.7 \xc3\x97 2.5 \n 1.531252% \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Silverfish \n 8.3 \xc3\x97 8.3 \xc3\x97 2.7 \n 0.28125% \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Zombie \n   Skeleton \n   Blaze \n 8.6 x 8.6 x 3.8 \n 1.125% \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Spider \n 9.4 \xc3\x97 9.4 \xc3\x97 2.9 \n 6.125% \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n 8\xc3\x978\xc3\x973 is the actual volume across which spawners spawn entities, but this volume only contains the entity\'s center . The failure rate assumes 8\xc3\x978\xc3\x974 because it is a popular misconception that 8\xc3\x978\xc3\x974 is the maximum efficiency volume of empty space for mob spawners - it actually depends on the size of the entities themselves. Note that 10x10x4 is guaranteed to accommodate all of the above mobs. Also note that this failure rate only accounts for failures due to attempting to spawn a mob at the edges of the spawn range, not other causes of failure such as mobs attempting to spawn intersecting the spawner block itself. \n \n \n For all of the volumes listed in the table, the horizontal plane is centered on the northwestern corner of the spawner block. While the spawning volume for pigs is 8.9 \xc3\x97 8.9 \xc3\x97 2.9, the requirement of grass blocks that are necessary for pigs to spawn will reduce the actual volume in which they successfully spawn. \n The block will attempt to spawn 4 mobs at randomly chosen points within the spawning area, then wait anywhere from 200 to 799 ticks (10 to 39.95 seconds) before spawning again. As it waits, the mob inside the block will spin faster and faster. Except for spawning on a solid block, all of the usual requirements for spawning must be met (not in a solid block, correct light level, etc.), so the spawner will often produce fewer than 4 mobs. When it does spawn, it will "poof", and more lightless flames will temporarily appear around the Spawn block. If the block fails to spawn any mobs because it did not pick any suitable locations, it will repeat this process every tick until it succeeds. Only when it manages to spawn at least one mob will it start waiting for the next cycle. If, at the time of spawning, 6 or more monsters of the block\'s type are present within a 17 \xc3\x97 9 \xc3\x97 17 area (17 wide and 9 high and 17 long), centered on the spawner block, the spawner "poofs" without creating any monsters and then waits for the next cycle. However, if there are more of the mob outside of the specified range, then the monster spawner will continue spawning mobs indefinitely. \n In Peaceful difficulty , Monster Spawner blocks will still appear, but any spawned hostile mobs will disappear the instant they spawn. ( Zombie Pigmen , Magma Cubes , and Ghasts will not spawn at all.) This makes it easy to make the traps without being troubled by the mobs. The brief instant that the monster exists in the world before being removed is enough time for the player to be pushed around, for the sound file to play, and occasionally for Skeletons to fire arrows. \n [ edit ] Detailed spawning algorithm \n This pseudo-code is derived from the decompiled source of 1.4.2. \n \nevery spawn cycle (every randInt(200,799) ticks when a player is within\n 17 blocks of the spawner),\nloop 4 times {\n  if there are 6 or more of the mob type in the 17x9x17 area around the spawner,\n   skip this spawn cycle\n  calculate spawnerX = X coordinate of center of spawner - 0.5\n  calculate spawnerY = Y coordinate of center of spawner - 0.5\n  calculate spawnerZ = Z coordinate of center of spawner - 0.5\n  calculate x coordinate of mob = spawnerX + (randDouble() - randDouble()) * 4,\n   randDouble being a random number between 0 and 1\n  calculate y coordinate of mob = spawnerY + a random integer between -1 and 1\n  calculate z coordinate of mob = spawnerZ + (randDouble() - randDouble()) * 4,\n   randDouble being a random number between 0 and 1\n  if all of the conditions specific to the mob type are met, spawn the mob {\n   chicken, cow, mooshroom, pig, sheep, wolf:\n    block below spawning block is grass\n    spawning block has a light level of 9 or higher\n\n   ocelot:\n    pass a 2/3 random test\n    block below spawning block is grass or leaves\n    on layer 63 or higher\n\n   creeper, enderman, skeleton, spider, cave spider, zombie:\n    light level 7 or less\n\n   blaze:\n    light level 11 or less\n\n   silverfish:\n    light level 11 or less, or on Stone blocks\n    no players within 5 blocks\n\n   slime:\n    difficulty is not set to peaceful or slime size is small \n    either:\n      spawn block y coordinate is less than 40\n      the chunk containing the spawn block is a slime chunk (1 in 10 chance)\n      pass a 1 in 10 random test\n    or:\n      swamp biome, layer 51 through 69, light level 7 or less\n   \n   ghast:\n    pass a 1 in 20 random test\n   \n   squid:\n    must not collide with any other entities\n    must be in layer 46-62\n   \n   giant:\n    light level 7 or less\n    light level 8 or more\n    (since these conditions can\'t be true simultaneously, giant spawners don\'t work)\n   \n   all except squid and slimes:\n    must not collide with any blocks or other entities\n    must not collide with water or lava\n  }\n}\nif all 4 mobs failed to spawn, repeat on the next tick\n \n [ edit ] Custom Spawners \n Monster Spawners are capable of much more than they are used for in vanilla Minecraft. Using external tools such as inventory or map editors, they can be customized in many ways: \n \n They can be made to spawn any kind of entity, including any mob, items, minecarts, boats, falling blocks, primed TNT, and so on. \n A single spawner can spawn multiple different entities, chosen at random from a list. \n Properties can be set on the spawned entities, such as their location, velocity, inventory, potion effects, and much much more. \n Various range and timing properties of the spawner can be altered. \n \n Detailed technical information about custom spawners can be found in the chunk format reference. \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Infdev \n \n \n Seecret Friday Update 2 \n Added mob spawners. They could be picked up and when placed, spawned pigs . \n \n \n June 27, 2010 \n Mob spawners given a unique ID, reducing crashes. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n Beta \n Changed name from mob spawner to monster spawner. \n \n \n 1.2 \n Monster spawners again now show a rotating model inside of what they spawn in single player after being missing for several versions. \n \n \n 1.9pre1 \n Changed monster spawner texture to a darker color. \n \n \n 1.9pre4 \n It was possible to obtain a monster spawner using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. When placed they would only spawn pigs. \n \n \n Silk Touch became ineffective on spawners. \n \n \n 1.9pre5 \n Squid spawners now only work in a narrow elevation range, from 46 to 62. \n \n \n Monster Spawners no longer drop after destroyed. Even when you use a Silk Touch pickaxe, it will not drop. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0.0 \n Monster spawners are now easier to destroy. \n \n \n 1.2.1 \n 12w06a \n Monster spawners now show the mob they are spawning in multiplayer; previously it always showed a pig. \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w22a \n Monster spawners will now drop experience when destroyed. \n \n \n 12w26a \n Monster spawners now support extra data pertaining to what they spawn. For example, they can spawn Charged Creepers, Endermen holding specific blocks, previously unavailable Green Robe Villagers, and Villagers offering specific deals. They can also spawn non-mob entities, like specific dropped items, random fireworks, primed TNT, boats and minecarts. \n \n \n [ edit ] Issues \n Issues relating to "Monster Spawner" are maintained on Mojira. Report issues there. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n It is possible to choose which mob a spawner will spawn, but unless you know what each mob in its tile data is, this will be difficult. \n Since monster spawners are stored as tile entities, they cannot be pushed by pistons . \n It is possible for a monster spawner to occur near the surface and completely buried in sand , with monsters spawning in small gaps underneath sandstone . \n Unlike most other solid blocks, the monster spawner supports texture with transparent areas, without showing what\'s behind. \n It is possible for two monster spawners to naturally occur directly side-by-side. \n As of version 1.2.5, monster spawners are available in creative mode by using the Pick Block button on a natural generated monster spawner. When placed, they will spawn pigs if there is a grass block in the vicinity of the spawner. \n The traditional torch on the spawner may not be sufficient to completely disable it. Lighting the walls as well is safer. \n When mining near a monster spawner that has no valid places to spawn, sometimes a monster will spawn immediately after a block is mined. The player should take caution for this reason while collecting Moss Stone from a dungeon but hasn\'t destroyed the monster spawner. It\'s speculated this might happen because the spawner gets a chance to spawn before the lighting calculation for the space the block occupied. \n If a spawner is made to spawn a Giant, the mob still spins, but appears outside the spawner because of the mob\'s size. \n A monster spawner may spawn 1, 2, 3 or even 4 mobs at once [1] \n If the game is set on Peaceful, the mobs will spawn, but will immediately de-spawn, as usual. In some cases, mobs will play their sound file before they de-spawn. It is also possible for a skeleton to shoot its arrow at the player before it de-spawns. \n If the player is not within range, the miniature mob inside the spawner will stop spinning, and the mob spawner will stop emitting fire particles, along with not working all together. \n The miniature mob inside the mob spawner will spin faster when it is about to spawn monsters. There are set minimum and maximum speeds for which the miniature mob can rotate. \n Zombie Pigmen spawners cannot be disabled with light. They can spawn at any light level. \n As of 1.0.1, Monster Spawners now show a miniature figure of the mob they will spawn (Single Player only, Xbox 360 Edition). \n The miniature mob inside the monster spawner is an actual mob of that type. Thus, if a spawner is configured to spawn Ender Dragons or Withers , their boss health bar is visible while looking at the spawner. \n Mob spawners can be edited to spawn any entity. \n The spawn range, rate, location, and player detection range can be edited. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A blaze spawner in a nether fortress. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon , connected to another dungeon, with two spawners. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A Giant spawner \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A Ghast spawner \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A spawner edited to spawn zombies wearing enchanted diamond armor. \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Dungeon \n Monster Spawner Traps \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n [1] Video clearly showing two, three and four mobs spawning at the same time from a monster spawner. \n \n \n \n Blocks [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Blocks/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Monster_Spawner&amp;oldid=500035 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Blocks TileEntity Natural blocks  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t Portugu\xc3\xaas do Brasil \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 2 July 2013, at 01:23. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

Its primary purpose is to tell the game engine if it needs to draw behind the block; an opaque block completely obscures the view behind it, while a transparent block does not. Thus, transparency applies not only to clear blocks like ice and glass , but also things like cacti , stairs , and single slabs , which do not completely fill their block space. \n By default, opacity also affects how light propagates through the world. Opaque blocks completely prevent light from travelling through them, while transparent blocks diminish it by one intensity per block. This value can be overridden however, and there are several anomalies . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Types of transparent blocks \n 2 List of things affected by opacity \n 3 Anomalies \n 4 Trivia \n 5 See also \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Types of transparent blocks \n \n \n Cube Solids \n \n \n   Ice \n   Glass \n   Leaves (Fancy graphics) \n   Piston (Retracted) \n   Glowstone \n \n \n \n \n Non-Cube Solids \n \n \n   Farmland \n   Slab (Single slabs) \n   Stairs \n   Ladder \n   Fence \n   Fence Gate \n   Nether Brick Fence \n   Cobblestone Wall \n   Iron Bars \n   Glass Pane \n   Cake \n   Bed \n   Door \n   Redstone Repeater \n   Trapdoor \n   Chest \n   Ender Chest \n   Trapped Chest \n   Piston (Extended) \n   Enchantment Table \n   Anvil \n   Brewing Stand \n   End Portal (block) \n   Hopper \n   Daylight Sensor \n   Snow (cover) (2 - 8 layers) \n   Lily Pad \n \n \n \n \n Non-Solid Mechanisms \n \n \n   Rail \n   Lever \n   Pressure Plate \n   Button \n   Redstone Wire \n   Redstone Torch \n \n \n \n \n Non-Solids \n \n \n Air \n   Snow (cover) (single layer) \n   Torch \n   Sign \n   Fire \n   Portal \n   End Portal \n   Carpet \n \n \n \n \n Plants \n \n \n   Cactus \n   Sugar Cane \n   Crops \n   Flowers \n   Mushrooms \n   Saplings \n   Grass \n   Stems \n \n \n \n \n Fluids \n \n \n   Water \n   Lava \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] List of things affected by opacity \n A lot of the effects of opacity are non-obvious. Minecraft does not have a "solid" property on blocks, so opacity is tested when a test for "solidity" would normally occur. \n \n Opaque blocks suffocate you, while transparent blocks do not. \n Monsters cannot spawn on transparent blocks, nor can they spawn inside opaque blocks. However, they can spawn inside a non-solid transparent block, such as flowers or Redstone Wires . \n You cannot attach torches or other wall fixtures to transparent blocks, nor can you place signs or other items on top of them. Here\'s the full list of blocks that are restricted this way: beds , buttons , redstone repeaters , ladders , levers , pressure plates , pumpkins , rails , snow (not snow block , which is OK), torches (including redstone torches ), and Redstone wire . \n Water which is completely surrounded by water or opaque blocks won\'t have a current. However, if one of the surrounding blocks is transparent the water will flow down like a waterfall, making it much slower to swim up. \n Opaque blocks overhead can prevent redstone wires from connecting to each other. See the article for details. \n Tree leaves can overwrite transparent blocks when they grow, but they will not overwrite opaque blocks. \n Chests cannot be opened if there is an opaque block on top of them, but transparent blocks above Chests do not prevent them from being opened (if want it to look like a solid cube is above it use stairs and it will still open). \n Opacity affects door orientation when placed. Doors open counter-clockwise by default, but if they have an opaque wall along their left side they open clockwise. \n Ghast fireball explosions only start fires on opaque blocks. \n A bed can only successfully reset the player\'s spawn point if the block at its head is opaque. Beds with transparent blocks at their heads may still be slept in, but dying will cause the player to respawn at the original spawn point with the message "Your home bed was missing or obstructed." \n Particles that are affected by gravity (e.g. slime particles) will fall through transparent blocks, but will stop on opaque blocks. \n \n [ edit ] Anomalies \n \n Leaves don\'t have any extra effect on block light , but they do diffuse sky light (light from the sky will start to get dimmer when it goes through leaves). \n Slabs , stairs , and farmland block light completely, even though they are transparent blocks. Also, for the purposes of most game logic, the light level of the block itself is equal to the maximum light level of any of the blocks directly beside or above it. As a result, if these blocks are lit from the top or sides, they are typically one level brighter than a transparent block would be at the same location. \n Water and ice are transparent, but have a -2 modifier to light propagation, on top of the normal decrease of 1 per block. \n Glass does not reduce the light passing through it, i.e. there is no additional modifier. In other words, light passes through Glass as if it were air. \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Lava is transparent as you would expect, but it is set to completely block light propagation. This is usually unnoticeable since lava has an intrinsic luminance of 15. \n Only opaque blocks can be powered by Redstone power. This can be observed by placing a redstone torch underneath glass , and then noting how adjacent wires are not powered. (If you replace the glass with something opaque they will get power.) \n In the Nether , your spawn point will always be on top of an opaque block. This is hard to observe, since you warp back to the normal world when you die in the nether. \n If a non-transparent block is given transparent pixels in an edited terrain.png, then instead of showing the block behind it through the transparent part, you will see beyond into the void and any open areas beyond.

Ice blocks can be obtained using any tool with the silk touch enchantment . \n Ice can be easily destroyed without tools , but the use of a pickaxe speeds up the process. If there is another block directly underneath the ice block, it will revert back to water when broken. If not, it will shatter without producing water. Due to its transparency , ice cannot have Torches placed on it directly. \n Ice will also melt into water if the light level immediately next to it on any side is sufficiently high (greater than 11), from light sources other than sunlight . Conversely, a water block in a snowy biome will eventually freeze into ice if exposed to the sky from directly above, and the light level immediately adjacent to the water block on all sides is sufficiently low (less than 13). This can happen at any time of day , and in any weather condition. If the highest adjacent light level is 12, an ice block will alternately melt and re-freeze when it receives a block tick. Water will not freeze into ice unless there is a solid block adjacent to it, such as dirt or another block of ice. \n Items and broken blocks move extremely fast when in water that is flowing over ice. This is particularly useful for transporting resources using water currents because items will keep sliding on ice blocks when they are dropped at an angle, even if water is not placed on top. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Potential uses \n 2 Farming Ice \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Issues \n 6 Trivia \n 7 Gallery \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Potential uses \n \n The repeated thawing and freezing at light level 12 can be used to make a redstone noise generator. Use a BUD to catch the random events. \n If creating a water slide, ice blocks can be used as the bottom pieces of the slide to speed up item movement. \n Because items exiting a water flow will continue to slide on up to two blocks on ice, sequences of flowing water over ice can be used to transport items indefinitely with no vertical drop necessary. \n Items that exit water flowing over ice can slide up to nine blocks on ice. \n The player can use Silk Touch to collect ice blocks and place them in the Nether . However, they don\'t make water when broken or melted. \n Making a 2-block high hallway with an ice floor, and trapdoors above the ice then sprint-jumping down it causes the fastest possible speed in the game. However, this will rapidly deplete the player\'s hunger bar . \n The player can build structures with ice in a tundra biome by putting dirt (or any other blocks) around the walls that will be built. After the player lays out one level of dirt, the player can pour water into the layout with buckets until all blocks have become ice. After this, make another level and repeat. There should be no blocks anywhere above the block of water the player wants to freeze, since water will not freeze with blocks directly above it. \n When placed on ice, Cobweb\'s &amp; Soul Sand\'s slowing effect will be greatly increased. This makes it helpful for live capture traps. \n Ice can be used as a stackable water source. \n The player can build structures with ice floor so items slip from 6-8 blocks away when thrown, this can be used to play "mini golf" by throwing items and trying to get them into a specific block, such as holes or any other block different than ice such as a hopper. \n Ice blocks behind other ice blocks are invisible. This makes for a great ice maze. Other items that dont show behind ice are water and lava. However, if lava is one block away from the ice, the ice will melt into a water block. \n \n [ edit ] Farming Ice \n Main article: Ice Farming \n Since Minecraft 1.3, Ice can now legitimately be obtained in survival mode, with a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe. That being said, farming ice can now be done if a contraption is made in that it can constantly create infinite water sources. This would have to be done in a snow biome in order for the ice to replace the water source blocks. \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.0.4 \n Added ice block. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.9pre4 \n Mining ice with a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch would cause ice to drop, which could then be brought to the Nether as a source of water. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0 \n Now ice blocks cannot be collected with the Silk Touch enchantment because of the above loophole. \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w17a \n Ice blocks can now be legitimately obtained in survival mode by harvesting them with a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe. However, the ability for ice to create water in the Nether was removed. \n \n \n [ edit ] Issues \n Issues relating to "Ice" are maintained on Mojira. Report issues there. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n If a player rides a pig on ice using a saddle , the pig moves incredibly fast, making journeys across long frozen lakes easier. \n By sprinting and jumping while on ice and inside a 2-block tall tunnel, it is possible to move 16 blocks a second, twice as fast as a full-speed minecart . By replacing the 2-block ceiling with trapdoors , it\'s possible to travel 1000 blocks in 54 seconds, or 18.518 blocks per second. However, this will drain the player\'s hunger bar extremely quickly at roughly 1 unit per second. \n Ice isn\'t as translucent as glass, so light passes through ice blocks diffusely, reducing the light level by 2 per ice block. \n Ice doesn\'t look transparent in the inventory or when your character holds it but will look translucent when placed. \n Along with Portals and Water , Ice is one of the few blocks that uses translucent pixels (colored but still semi-transparent) in the default Minecraft texture pack . \n If viewed through a portal, ice is invisible and the ground beneath it can be seen. \n Although it is seemingly translucent, water cannot be seen through ice, nor can other ice blocks. The same thing happens when ice is placed with lava . This only occurs with blocks in close vicinity unlike water where the ice can be any distance from it. \n It is possible to see the edges of chunks through ice, but only in "Fast" graphics setting . \n Sugar cane can be found next to ice, though when updated they will drop as items. This can be observed at random when running through a snowy biome. \n If you try to light ice on fire with a flint and steel no flames will appear, but the flint and steel will still act as if it had been used (its durability will decrease slightly). The same thing happens with glass . \n If an ocean biome is beside a snow biome, "ice shelves" may be formed. \n If the user is playing on a non-snow Alpha map generated before the Halloween update, as of 1.6, oceans may freeze over because of ice regeneration in the newly generated snow biomes. [1] \n Water can only freeze if there is at least one horizontally adjacent non-water block.

You can see redstone being dropped and a chicken behind the trees on the right. If the chicken gets closer to the TNT when it explodes, it will die just like other mobs when they get caught in an explosion. \n \n \n An explosion is a physical event in the Minecraft world, caused by a primed TNT , an exploding creeper , a bed in The Nether or in The End , an Ender Crystal , a Wither \'s projectile/activation, or a Ghast \'s fireball. An explosion can destroy nearby blocks , propel and damage nearby entities, and cause one or more fires . Explosions produce shockwave particles, but before 1.8 they produced smoke particles. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Properties \n 2 Effects \n \n 2.1 Model of block destruction \n 2.2 Interaction with entities \n \n 2.2.1 Calculation of explosion exposure \n \n \n 2.3 Causing fire \n 2.4 Permanent lag \n \n \n 3 Blast resistance \n 4 Typical damage radius \n 5 History \n 6 Trivia \n 7 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Properties \n \n Position .

(However, this only defines their directions, not their length) \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe roughly spherical pattern of blocks destroyed can be seen here. \n \n \n [ edit ] Effects \n [ edit ] Model of block destruction \n An explosion can destroy nearby blocks. Its blast effect is evaluated independently on many explosion rays originating from the explosion center, as shown in the right figure. \n \n Each ray has an initial blast force randomized in [0.7&#160;\xc3\x97 power , 1.3&#160;\xc3\x97 power ]. \n The effect of the blast force is examined at checkpoints on the ray with step length of 0.3. \n The blast force is absorbed ( block resistance /5&#160;+ 0.3)&#160;\xc3\x97 step length by the non-air block (no matter whether destroyed) at each checkpoint, and attenuated by step length &#160;\xc3\x97 0.75 between checkpoints, until completely absorbed or attenuated. \n A block is considered destroyed if it can\'t completely absorb the blast force at any checkpoint in it (air blocks can be destroyed too). \n \n From the above process, the following results can be deduced (where \xe2\x8c\x8a x \xe2\x8c\x8b is the floor function): \n \n The blast radius in the air of an explosion (i.e. only attenuated, not absorbed by blocks)&#160;= \xe2\x8c\x8a1.3&#160;\xc3\x97 power /( step length &#160;\xc3\x97 0.75)\xe2\x8c\x8b&#160;\xc3\x97 step length = 10.2 (charged creepers), 6.9 (TNT), 5.1 (creepers), 1.5 (fireballs). For example, a TNT explosion can destroy a torch 7 blocks away. But how many blocks an explosion can destroy is non-deterministic and also dependent on the specific location of the explosion. \n The minimum block resistance required to absorb maximum blast force of an explosion happening in nearby air&#160;= ((1.3&#160;\xc3\x97 power &#160;\xe2\x88\x92 attenuation steps &#160;\xc3\x97 step length &#160;\xc3\x97 0.75)/ step length &#160;\xe2\x88\x92 0.3)&#160;\xc3\x97 5. To not be destroyed, a block has to absorb all blast force at the first checkpoint in it.\n \n The attenuation steps is subject to collision restrictions. For explosion in air, there is at least one attenuation step. TNT and creeper explosion are always 0.49 and 0.5 meter away from nearest block (2 att. steps), but fireball explosion can happen anywhere (1 att. step). \n Thus, the block resistances are 121.00 (charged creepers), 77.67 (TNT), 56.00 (creepers), 16.42 (fireballs). \n So water , lava (Note: Only the stationary block) obsidian , and bedrock are always indestructible, and fences and less blast-resistant blocks can be destroyed by fireballs. These are theoretical values, and in reality less resistant blocks are not always destroyed, and since Minecraft is supposed to be simple, there is no such mechanic. \n \n \n \n \nNote that the effect of multiple explosions, no matter how simultaneous, on one block is evaluated independently and serially per explosion, and blocks don\'t have "temporary health" and such properties across explosion history. That means explosions have no cumulative effect on blocks. \n Destroyed blocks have a 1/ power chance of being dropped as items later. Because of that,it is not recommended to use TNT as a resource gatherer, as 75% of the blocks will be lost. \n [ edit ] Interaction with entities \n An explosion has different effects on entities than blocks. Entities are damaged and propelled by an explosion if within its damage radius of 2 \xc3\x97 power . Note that the "damage radius" is different from the blast radius of explosion effect on blocks. \n \n For each entity within the radius , define impact &#160;= (1&#160;\xe2\x88\x92 distance from the explosion / radius )&#160;\xc3\x97 exposure . \n Apply ( impact 2 &#160;+ impact )&#160;\xc3\x97 8&#160;\xc3\x97 power &#160;+ 1 point (half-heart, so we don\'t have to divide by 2 everywhere) of damage to the entity. \n Propel the entity so that its velocity increases by impact in the direction from explosion to the entity. \n \n From the above process, the following results can be deduced: \n \n Entities will always get at least 1 point of damage if they are within the radius, regardless of their explosion exposure. \n The maximum damage that entities can take (at the explosion center with 100% exposure)&#160;= (1&#160;\xc3\x97 1&#160;+ 1)&#160;\xc3\x97 8&#160;\xc3\x97 power &#160;+ 1 point of damage&#160;= 97 (charged creeper), 65 (TNT), 49 (creepers), 17 (fireballs). When entities are away or covered by blocks from the explosion center, they take less damage. \n The maximum velocity gain that an entity can obtain from a TNT explosion is 1, at the explosion center with 100% exposure. \n \n Different damage effects will ensue. For example, existing items will be destroyed, and the armor on the player will absorb part of the damage. Items dropped in the process of, or actually after, the explosion are not affected because they have no interaction between the explosion. \n The propulsion effect is often used for TNT cannons . \n \n \n \n  \nA primed TNT AABB has directionally asymmetrical sample points (1/2.96 spacing) because of rounding. \n \n \n [ edit ] Calculation of explosion exposure \n Explosion exposure is simply how much an entity is visible from the explosion center, and is approximated with the ratio of visible sample points on the entity. The approximation algorithm has sampling error that results in directional asymmetry of propulsion. For example, a typical TNT Cannon has maximum range in the west direction partly because the primed TNT has largest sampled exposure in that direction. \n [ edit ] Causing fire \n If the explosion has the ability, it randomly starts fires in 1/3 of all destroyed air blocks that are above opaque blocks. \n \n [ edit ] Permanent lag \n Permanent lag is essentially lag-fallout from an explosion, this consists of drops, liquid-physics, and increased render-complexity of the crater. It is recommended that when making a large creative-mode explosion, one uses the command "/gamerule doTileDrops false" to stop drops from being generated by explosions. \n [ edit ] Blast resistance \n [ edit values ] \n \n \n Block name \n Blast resistance \n \n \n Bedrock \n 18,000,000 \n \n \n Command Block \n 18,000,000 \n \n \n End Portal \n 18,000,000 \n \n \n End Portal block \n 18,000,000 \n \n \n Anvil \n 6,000 \n \n \n Enchantment Table \n 6,000 \n \n \n Obsidian \n 6,000 \n \n \n Ender Chest \n 3,000 \n \n \n Flowing Water \n 500 \n \n \n Lava \n 500 \n \n \n Water \n 500 \n \n \n Dragon Egg \n 45 \n \n \n End Stone \n 45 \n \n \n Block of Diamond \n 30 \n \n \n Block of Emerald \n 30 \n \n \n Block of Gold \n 30 \n \n \n Block of Iron \n 30 \n \n \n Block of Redstone \n 30 \n \n \n Brick Stairs \n 30 \n \n \n Bricks \n 30 \n \n \n Hardened Clay \n 30 \n \n \n Cobblestone \n 30 \n \n \n Cobblestone Stairs \n 30 \n \n \n Cobblestone Wall \n 30 \n \n \n Iron Bars \n 30 \n \n \n Jukebox \n 30 \n \n \n Moss Stone \n 30 \n \n \n Nether Brick \n 30 \n \n \n Nether Brick Fence \n 30 \n \n \n Nether Brick Stairs \n 30 \n \n \n Stone \n 30 \n \n \n Stone Brick \n 30 \n \n \n Stone Brick Stairs \n 30 \n \n \n Stone Slabs \n 30 \n \n \n Iron Door \n 25 \n \n \n Monster Spawner \n 25 \n \n \n Cobweb \n 20 \n \n \n Dispenser \n 17.5 \n \n \n Dropper \n 17.5 \n \n \n Furnace \n 17.5 \n \n \n Beacon \n 15 \n \n \n Coal Ore \n 15 \n \n \n Cocoa \n 15 \n \n \n Diamond Ore \n 15 \n \n \n Emerald Ore \n 15 \n \n \n Fence \n 15 \n \n \n Fence Gate \n 15 \n \n \n Gold Ore \n 15 \n \n \n \n \n Block name \n Blast resistance \n \n \n Hopper \n 15 \n \n \n Iron Ore \n 15 \n \n \n Lapis Lazuli Block \n 15 \n \n \n Lapis Lazuli Ore \n 15 \n \n \n Nether Quartz Ore \n 15 \n \n \n Redstone Ore \n 15 \n \n \n Trapdoor \n 15 \n \n \n Wood Planks \n 15 \n \n \n Wooden Door \n 15 \n \n \n Wooden Slabs \n 15 \n \n \n Wooden Stairs \n 15 \n \n \n Chest \n 12.5 \n \n \n Crafting Table \n 12.5 \n \n \n Trapped Chest \n 12.5 \n \n \n Cauldron \n 10 \n \n \n Wood \n 10 \n \n \n Bookshelf \n 7.5 \n \n \n Jack \'o\' Lantern \n 5 \n \n \n Melon \n 5 \n \n \n Mob head \n 5 \n \n \n Pumpkin \n 5 \n \n \n Sign \n 5 \n \n \n Block of Quartz \n 4 \n \n \n Note Block \n 4 \n \n \n Quartz Stairs \n 4 \n \n \n Sandstone \n 4 \n \n \n Sandstone Stairs \n 4 \n \n \n Wool \n 4 \n \n \n Monster Egg \n 3.75 \n \n \n Activator Rail \n 3.5 \n \n \n Detector Rail \n 3.5 \n \n \n Powered Rail \n 3.5 \n \n \n Rail \n 3.5 \n \n \n Clay (block) \n 3 \n \n \n Farmland \n 3 \n \n \n Grass Block \n 3 \n \n \n Gravel \n 3 \n \n \n Sponge \n 3 \n \n \n Brewing Stand \n 2.5 \n \n \n Button \n 2.5 \n \n \n Cake \n 2.5 \n \n \n Dirt \n 2.5 \n \n \n Ice \n 2.5 \n \n \n Lever \n 2.5 \n \n \n Mycelium \n 2.5 \n \n \n Piston \n 2.5 \n \n \n Piston Extension \n 2.5 \n \n \n Pressure Plate \n 2.5 \n \n \n \n \n Block name \n Blast resistance \n \n \n Sand \n 2.5 \n \n \n Soul Sand \n 2.5 \n \n \n Sticky Piston \n 2.5 \n \n \n Weighted Pressure Plate \n 2.5 \n \n \n Cactus \n 2 \n \n \n Ladder \n 2 \n \n \n Netherrack \n 2 \n \n \n Glass \n 1.5 \n \n \n Glass Pane \n 1.5 \n \n \n Glowstone \n 1.5 \n \n \n Redstone Lamp \n 1.5 \n \n \n Bed \n 1 \n \n \n Daylight Sensor \n 1 \n \n \n Huge Mushrooms \n 1 \n \n \n Leaves \n 1 \n \n \n Snow Block \n 1 \n \n \n Vines \n 1 \n \n \n Snow (cover) \n 0.5 \n \n \n Air \n 0 \n \n \n Carrot \n 0 \n \n \n Dead Bush \n 0 \n \n \n Fire \n 0 \n \n \n Flower Pot \n 0 \n \n \n Flowers \n 0 \n \n \n Flowing Lava \n 0 \n \n \n Grass \n 0 \n \n \n Lily Pad \n 0 \n \n \n Locked Chest \n 0 \n \n \n Melon Stem \n 0 \n \n \n Mushrooms \n 0 \n \n \n Nether Portal \n 0 \n \n \n Nether Wart \n 0 \n \n \n Piston Moving \n 0 \n \n \n Potato \n 0 \n \n \n Pumpkin Stem \n 0 \n \n \n Redstone Comparator \n 0 \n \n \n Redstone Repeater \n 0 \n \n \n Redstone Torch \n 0 \n \n \n Redstone Wire \n 0 \n \n \n Saplings \n 0 \n \n \n Seeds \n 0 \n \n \n Sugar Cane \n 0 \n \n \n TNT \n 0 \n \n \n Torch \n 0 \n \n \n Tripwire \n 0 \n \n \n Tripwire Hook \n 0 \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Typical damage radius \n The player will get certain damage if within these radii of a 100% exposure ground 1-, 2-, or 4-TNT explosion, as shown in the following figures with the amount of damage shown on each circle. \n    \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Classic \n \n \n 0.24 \n Creepers were first introduced in on August 24, 2009, based on a failed pig model Notch had created. \n \n \n 0.26 (October 24, 2009) \n TNT was added. \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.2 \n Added Ghasts, which shoot explosive ghast fireballs. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.5 \n Creepers become charged when struck by lightning, increasing the explosion\'s radius and strength. \n \n \n 1.6 \n Trying to sleep in the Nether causes the bed to explode. \n \n \n 1.8 \n Explosions will now emit shockwave particles after exploding. Prior to Beta 1.8, explosions only emitted smoke. \n \n \n 1.9pre3 \n Bed and ghast explosions cause fire. \n \n \n 1.9pre4 \n Trying to sleep in the End causes the bed to explode. \n \n \n Enchantment "Blast Protection" added, protecting against explosions. \n \n \n 1.9pre6 \n Ender Crystal added, an entity which sits atop of a block of bedrock. It can be destroyed with a melee or hit with an arrow, causing an explosion. \n \n \n Sound Update \n The \'Sound Update\' of November 13th 2011 gave TNT a new explosion sound. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w24a \n Fixed explosions not pushing back players. \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n Explosions damage the player different amounts on different difficulties, and no damage is dealt to the player on peaceful. \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w34a \n Added the Wither, which shoots black wither skulls. \n \n \n 12w37a \n Wither will make a massive explosion upon its creation after its health is fully charged. \n \n \n Blue wither skulls added. \n \n \n 12w38b \n New Creeper fall mechanics; Creepers will explode if they fall on the player from a certain height. \n \n \n 1.5 \n Destroyed blocks have a 1/ power chance of dropping as items; previously it was a fixed 30% chance. \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Explosions more powerful than 100 look mostly the same from the outside, as only certain lines are used to determine if a block breaks. However, some of those lines continue underground. \n \n \n An explosion powerful enough to break bedrock would have a blast radius of over 30,000,000 blocks. If it were an uninterrupted blast, it would cover 238,775,501.2 blocks. However, explosions only follow certain lines, not every block (see previous). \n \n \n Any explosion going off in flowing water will apply propulsion to entities, but it will not affect any block, whether the blast resistance of that block is low or high. \n \n \n Explosions in or under water won\'t create smoke particles. \n \n \n Explosions can redirect projectiles including Ender Pearls. \n \n \n Explosions can break blocks through blocks that meet at an edge and aren\'t destroyed. \n \n \n When you kill a mob and TNT explodes just after the mob falls on the ground, it will push the dead mob back before it evaporates into smoke. \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \n \n Minecraft by Mojang AB and 4J Studios \n \n \n Development cycle \n \n \n \n Computer \n \n \n \n Version history \n \n

Redstone ore blocks can only be obtained with a Silk Touch pickaxe, and smelting redstone ore only produces one item of Redstone, while placing the block and mining it can produce 4-5 items of redstone (up to 8 with a Fortune tool). \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Redstone Ore \n \n \n \n    \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] As a crafting ingredient \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Stick , \nRedstone \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Redstone Torch , \nRedstone, \n Stone \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Gold Ingots , \nRedstone \n \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Iron Ingots , \nRedstone \n \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Wood Planks , \nRedstone \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Gold Ingots , \n Stick , \nRedstone \n \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n   6  \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Iron Ingots , \n Stone Pressure Plate , \nRedstone \n \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n   6  \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Cobblestone , \n Bow , \nRedstone \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Wood Planks , \n Cobblestone , \n Iron Ingot , \nRedstone \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Redstone + \n Glowstone \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Redstone \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Cobblestone + \n Redstone \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] As a brewing ingredient \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n Description \n \n \n Redstone \n+ \n Water Bottle \n= \n Mundane Potion \n(Extended) \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Redstone + \n Potion of Fire Resistance or \n Potion of Regeneration or \n Potion of Strength or \n Potion of Swiftness or \n Potion of Night Vision or \n Potion of Invisibility \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n    \n     \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Make base/reverted/level II potions extend their duration. \n \n \n Redstone + \n Potion of Healing II or \n Potion of Harming II \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n    \n     \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Revert to level I. \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.0.1 \n Added redstone dust.

It is possible, however, to connect levers, buttons and pressure plates directly to these objects, as redstone wire is not needed when switches are directly adjacent to objects. \n Redstone\'s shape is shared by glowstone dust , gunpowder and sugar . \n Another good use for redstone, as people generally accumulate too much of it while exploring natural dungeons, is to use it as a way to find your way in a cave, so that you do not get lost. By placing redstone on the right-hand side of the cave, you can find your way out again by keeping the placed redstone dust on your left. \n Redstone is also useful for making an obsidian generator. This is a bug that will likely be patched in a later update, but is currently a safe and economical way to get obsidian. By using one bucket of water and one of lava, redstone can be converted into obsidian. [1] \n In multiplayer , if PvP is disabled, one can still kill someone by using redstone to make a trap . \n In the Pocket Edition , redstone ore exists, but if you try to mine it, it will not drop any redstone. \n The electronic and magnetic qualities of Redstone may allude to copper, which is reddish-orange in colour and used in generators, electromagnets, motors, coils and wiring; or less likely to 2 real life forms of Iron Ore called hematite and magnetite which are reddish-brown and black in colour, respectively, and both have properties that allow use in magnetic data storage and for primitive magnets. \n Programmable tiles were originally supposed to be added in an expansion pack called Dungeons and Levers after the release. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Mechanisms \n Traps \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngiWl6x9A24 \n \n \n \n \n  Redstone \n \n \n Redstone circuit \n \n \n Clock circuit \n Logic circuit \n Memory circuit \n Miscellaneous circuits \n Pulse circuit \n Transmission circuit \n \n \n \n \n Featured tutorials \n \n \n Advanced redstone circuits \n Basic logic gates \n Block update detectors \n Mechanisms \n Piston circuits \n \n \n \n \n Power components \n \n \n   Block of Redstone \n   Button \n   Daylight Sensor \n   Detector Rail \n   Lever \n   Pressure Plate \n   Redstone Torch \n   Trapped Chest \n   Tripwire Hook \n \n   Tripwire \n \n \n   Weighted Pressure Plate \n \n \n \n \n Transmission components \n \n \n   Redstone Comparator \n   Redstone Repeater \n   Redstone Wire \n \n \n \n \n Mechanism components \n \n \n   Command Block \n   Dropper \n   Dispenser \n   Door \n   Fence Gate \n   Hopper \n   Note Block \n   Piston \n   Rail \n \n   Powered \n   Activator \n \n \n   Redstone Lamp \n   TNT \n   Trapdoor \n \n \n \n \n Miscellaneous \n \n \n   Redstone Ore \n Redstone style guide \n Help:Schematic \n \n \n \n \n \n Items [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Items/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Redstone&amp;oldid=503768 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Raw Materials Redstone  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t Italiano \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t Portugu\xc3\xaas do Brasil \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 10 July 2013, at 07:22. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy;

Charges can be used to activate certain blocks, such as doors . It is the placed form of redstone , which can be found by mining redstone ore with an iron pickaxe or better. Unpowered wire will appear dark red, and powered wire will appear bright red with animated sparkling. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Usage \n 2 Video \n 3 History \n 4 Issues \n 5 Trivia \n 6 Gallery \n 7 See also \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Usage \n Redstone wire will transfer power provided by power sources from block to block. It can be connected to other wires to create circuits . However, it will not try to form visible connections with blocks or items that "receive" power, like doors. These blocks need a straight wire run to or onto them in order to receive power. Redstone wire cannot be placed on glass or glass panes . \n It is possible to tell whether a wire is connected to other blocks by its appearance: when placed alone and unconnected it looks like a dot on the surface of the block, but it will power all four surrounding blocks. If it is connected in all four directions, a wire looks like a cross (+). If it has one connection or two on opposite sides, it will look like a straight line (- or |), depending on the location of the blocks connected). Bends and T-junctions are also possible, when connected on the appropriate sides. \n Powered redstone wire will glow dimmer the farther it is from its source of power. Power will only travel through 15 blocks of wire, beyond which it stops sparkling entirely. It is possible, however, to extend this range with gates or repeaters . The creation and use of gates are explained in the redstone circuits article. \n Redstone wire will connect by running straight up and down the sides of blocks when changing levels, but there are some restrictions: the wire will only cross a 1-block difference in height.

This is not a practical way to find string though, as killing spiders can be used to get string more quickly and in larger quantities. In abandoned mine shafts and libraries in strongholds , there are cobwebs which can be cut with a sword or shears to get string. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 As a crafting ingredient \n 2 Tripwire \n \n 2.1 Usage \n 2.2 Placing and removing tripwires \n \n \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Trivia \n 6 Gallery \n 7 See also \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] As a crafting ingredient \n String can be used to make wool , but this is rather wasteful as wool can be obtained from sheep ; it is more economical to save string for making more fishing rods or more bows that can be used to make dispensers . \n \n \n Name \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Bow \n String + \n Stick \n \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Fishing Rod \n Stick + \n String \n \n \n \n   \n   \n    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n    \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n White Wool \n String \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lead \n String + \n Slimeball \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n   2  \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Tripwire \n \n Tripwire \n \n   \n \n \n \n Type \n \n Tool \n \n \n \n Physics \n \n No \n \n \n \n Transparency \n \n Yes \n \n \n \n Luminance \n \n No \n \n \n \n Blast resistance \n \n 0 \n \n \n \n Tool \n \n Any tool \n \n \n \n Renewable \n \n N/A \n \n \n \n Stackable \n \n Yes (64) \n \n \n \n Flammable \n \n No \n \n \n \n Availability \n \n ? \n \n \n \n First appearance \n \n 12w22a \n \n \n \n Data value \n \n dec : &#160;132 hex : &#160;84 bin : &#160;10000100 \n \n \n \n \n A tripwire is a small, gray wire that appears when string is placed. Tripwire is primarily used to output redstone signals when attached to tripwire hooks on opposite ends. Upon collision with most entities , a redstone pulse will be sent to the tripwire hooks connecting the tripwire. Tripwire\'s low visibility makes it an effective way of creating traps. Tripwire (along with tripwire hooks ), generate only in jungle temples . \n [ edit ] Usage \n To activate a tripwire when it is connected, an entity (most mobs , minecarts , boats , arrows , items , etc.) must move on, through or over it. However, thrown potions , some arrows, thrown Ender pearls , and thrown eyes of Ender will not activate tripwire hooks. Destroying the tripwire while not holding shears will trigger a redstone pulse. The redstone signal must connect to the tripwire hook to be activated, not the tripwire itself. Tripwire can be connected to other tripwire for up to 40 blocks. You can connect hooks with tripwire on the ground or connect hooks through air (see details below). When a tripwire connection is formed, the hooks must be placed on both sides of the connection for it to have the ability to be activated. \n Tripwires can also be used to help decorate a structure with vines. Placing a floating block of tripwire in midair without any attachments prevents vine blocks growing through it. This lets the player control where and how wide/long they want their vines to grow, or allows them to add patterns into the middle of large swaths of vines. This is particularly useful for high-altitude construction or floating islands that the player wants to have vines dangling from. Without a block to stop them, the vines will continue down until they hit the ground, but floating tripwires can keep them short and irregular without being seen for a more natural look (otherwise the player would have to use signs or other blocks that are conspicuous and/or bulky). \n [ edit ] Placing and removing tripwires \n Tripwires are placed with string. Tripwires connect like redstone wire , and can connect to tripwire on all four sides. Tripwire can be placed in the air, by placing it next to any solid block. Tripwire can also be placed on other tripwires. When breaking a block below tripwire, the tripwire is broken, activating the signal and string is dropped. If tripwire is placed on any block with transparency (glass, leaves, signs, air, chests, pistons, glowstone, slabs, stairs, etc.), it will not connect to tripwire hooks or tripwire placed on any block that is not glass or leaves. Yet, when one of these blocks is broken, the tripwire is not dropped nor activated (the tripwire remains in the air). This the same for when one is broken that has another tripwire placed on top. Tripwire has the same function when in the air as if it was on the ground. When making tripwires, Dinnerbone stated there either needs to be no blocks under any wire/hook or all blocks under the wire/hook; [1] however this is not actually the case. Since this "mix and match" is based on whether or not the underlying block has a transparency value, any block with a transparency value can be "mixed and matched" with air. When breaking tripwire itself, it activates any tripwire or tripwire hooks that it was connected to. To disarm tripwire without activating the signal, you must break the block with shears . This will remove the block and drop string, yet will not activate the signal. Tripwire has the hitbox of a slab when it is not connected to tripwire hooks. When it is connected, the hitbox is the same as redstone wire, unless it\'s placed in the air. Tripwire can be "stacked" on itself when being placed, like stacking signs on signs , but it will still float after removing the tripwire/block under it. \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Indev \n \n \n February 19, 2010 \n Added string, as a drop from spiders. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w22a \n String can be placed on the ground as a tripwire. Tripwire was first revealed on Dinnerbone \'s Twitter. [2] [3] Dinnerbone released a video showing him experimenting with tripwire before its release. [4] \n \n \n 12w23a \n Tripwire is now activated by most entities (including arrows ), and the max distance has been increased from 18 to 40 blocks. \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Walking onto or off from any piece of string next to a BUD switch, will cause it to update even if the string isn\'t connected to tripwire hooks. Breaking the block with Shears will do the same. \n Tripwire has the highest resolution of any block in the game: 64x64. In 13w03a this is tied with the Locked Chest . \n String is also referred to as "Silk". \n Tripwire can be placed on top of itself. \n When tripwire is placed upon ice or glass, its hit-box increases in size and the wire itself lays higher than normal. This makes it easier to see the wire, but it still functions as normal. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The first image released of Tripwires.

While running out of resources isn\'t likely to be a factor due to theoretically infinite (and still quite vast in practice) map generation, this is a list of resources that can be produced over and over without having to explore for more. However, running out of resources can be a bigger issue on Superflat worlds, where resources are less plentiful, or in PvP maps, where one would like to obtain resources without having to conquer more land. \n The listed fully renewable products are items which can be crafted , smelted , or brewed using only renewable resources. For example, Cookies are renewable as they only require Wheat and Cocoa Beans that can be regrown infinitely, while TNT isn\'t because it requires Sand , which is not renewable. \n Anything that is dropped by a monster or animal (besides the Dragon Egg dropped by the Ender Dragon and the Nether Star dropped by the Wither ) is renewable because all mobs (besides the Ender Dragon and Wither) can respawn and be killed again for more loot. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Renewable resources \n 2 Rare drops \n 3 Tradable \n 4 Renewable, but require non-renewable resources \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Renewable resources \n Resources that can be obtained indefinitely. Some require non-renewable materials in their production, but the process will never consume those materials. \n \n \n Resource \n Renewable products \n Renewable method \n \n \n Arrows \n \n \xe2\x80\x94 \n Arrows are dropped by Skeletons and can be traded by Villager farmers. \n \n \n Blaze Rods \n \n            \n Blaze rods are dropped by Blazes . \n \n \n Bones \n \n              \n Bones are dropped by Skeletons . \n \n \n Cactus \n \n       \n Cactus can be found in desert biomes and can be grown on sand . While sand is non-renewable, it is not consumed by the growth of cactus. \n \n \n Carrots \n \n     \n Carrots can be grown on tilled soil . They can be found on some village fields or as a rare drop of zombies . \n \n \n Coal / Charcoal \n  \n     \n Coal is dropped by killed Wither Skeletons . Charcoal is produced by smelting logs. Coal and Charcoal do not stack together, but serve the same purpose. As of snapshot 13w19a they are no longer identical, and Charcoal cannot be used to craft Blocks of Coal. \n \n \n Cobblestone and Stone \n  \n                    \n Created by letting non-renewable lava flow over or against water . One must not let water flow into the lava source, otherwise the lava will irreversibly convert into obsidian . \n \n \n Cocoa Beans \n \n     \n Cocoa pods (found on jungle trees) drop up to 3 beans, which can be replanted on jungle logs to produce more cocoa. \n \n \n Eggs \n \n  \n Chickens will lay eggs roughly every 5 \xe2\x80\x93 10 minutes. \n \n \n Ender Pearls \n \n  \n Dropped by killed Endermen . \n \n \n Experience Orb \n \n See enchanting \n Dropped by any mob killed by the player except for Villagers , Golems , Bats , or baby animals. Also may be obtained through fishing , smelting , and breeding . \n \n \n Feathers \n \n    \n Dropped by killed chickens . \n \n \n Flowers \n  \n           \n Can spawn when bone meal is used to generate patches of tall grass . This requires non-renewable Grass Blocks , (although it is very plentiful in a normal Overworld outside of a Mushroom Island, and they are not consumed to generate tall grass) and is the only way to obtain a renewable supply of Dandelions. Roses are also sometimes dropped by killed Iron Golems . \n \n \n Ghast Tears \n \n    \n Dropped by killed Ghasts . \n \n \n Glass Bottle \n \n                    \n Dropped by killed Witches . \n \n \n Glowstone Dust \n \n              \n Dropped by killed Witches or obtained by trading with villager priests. Also dropped by Blazes in the Xbox version. \n \n \n Gunpowder \n \n           \n Dropped by killed creepers , Ghasts , and Witches . \n \n \n Huge Mushroom \n   \n    \n Using bone meal on normal mushrooms will grow them into huge mushrooms (if there is enough space), which can then be broken to get more of the normal mushroom. With the Silk Touch enchantment though ( obtainable by trading with villager priests ), the huge mushroom blocks themselves can be collected. \n \n \n Ice \n \n  \n Water source blocks in a Ice Plains or Taiga biomes will turn into ice over time. Attempting to collect ice will break it into water if there is a block under it, outright destroying the broken block otherwise. With the Silk Touch enchantment though ( obtainable by trading with Villager priests ), the ice blocks can be successfully collected. \n \n \n Ink Sacs \n \n          \n Dropped by killing Squid . \n \n \n Leather \n \n        \n Dropped by killed Cows , Mooshrooms and Horses . \n \n \n Magma Cream \n \n    \n Dropped by killed Magma Cubes . \n \n \n Melon Seeds \n \n      \n Melon Seeds are found in Abandoned Mine Shafts . And be crafted from melon slices, which can be traded by villager farmers. Seeds can be renewed once grown by breaking a melon stem, or crafting them from melon slices. \n \n \n Milk \n \n  \n Obtained by milking Cows or Mooshrooms with a bucket . \n \n \n Mushrooms \n  \n     \n Using Bone Meal on normal mushrooms will grow them into Huge Mushrooms, if there is enough space, which can then be broken to get more of the normal mushroom. Normal mushrooms also spread slowly on their own. Also, Mooshrooms can be sheared for red mushrooms or milked for Mushroom Stew, which can also be crafted with a bowl and both mushrooms. \n \n \n Nether Wart \n \n                  \n Harvested from fully grown Nether wart . Must be planted on non-renewable Soul Sand , but it doesn\'t consume the block. \n \n \n Obsidian \n \n  \n \n \n Entering a nether portal for which there is no matching exit will generate 14 free blocks of obsidian (and 4 more "ledge" blocks if the portal is formed in mid-air). Only mining the corners (and "ledges") will keep the portal active if desired. More on here \n Each time entering an end portal will generate a 5x5 platform of obsidian at the same position in the end . In other words, the obsidian can be mined and will be "refilled" next time you re-enter the end (note that, to leave the end, you will have first to defeat the Enderdragon ). \n \n Diamond pickaxes, required to mine obsidian, can be obtained by trading with villager blacksmiths. \n \n \n \n Potatoes \n \n  \n Potatoes are a rare drop of zombies and can be harvested on some village fields, but once obtained, the player can grow them on tilled soil. Poisonous Potatoes are occasionally dropped by mature potato plants. \n \n \n Pumpkin Seeds \n \n   \n Pumpkin seeds are found in abandoned mine shafts , while pumpkins themselves are found "wild" in certain biomes. You can also get seeds from putting a pumpkin in a crafting slot or by breaking pumpkin stems . The seeds, of course, can be planted in farmland to generate more pumpkins. \n \n \n Raw Beef \n \n  \n Raw Beef is dropped by Cows and Mooshrooms . Steaks can also be traded by Villager butchers. \n \n \n Raw Chicken \n \n  \n Dropped by killed chickens . Cooked chickens can also be traded by villager farmers. \n \n \n Raw Fish \n \n  \n Obtained by fishing using a fishing rod . \n \n \n Raw Porkchop \n \n  \n Dropped by killed Pigs . Cooked porkchops can also be traded by Villager butchers. \n \n \n Redstone \n \n                           \n Obtained by killing a Witch or by trading with villager priests. \n \n \n Rotten Flesh \n \n \xe2\x80\x94 \n Dropped by killed Zombies and Zombie Pigmen . \n \n \n Saplings and Trees \n    \n                                                                 \n Trees can be grown from saplings placed on lit dirt ; When broken a leaf block has a 5% chance of dropping a sapling. See tree farming . Charcoal can be produced by smelting any kind of log. Leaves can be obtained by harvesting with shears . Sticks are also dropped by killed Witches . \n \n \n Seeds \n \n     \n Seeds can be planted on farmland . Harvesting the resulting crops may produce more Seeds. Seeds can also be harvested from tall grass . \n \n \n Slimeballs \n \n      \n Dropped by killed Slimes . \n \n \n Snowballs \n \n  \n In cold biomes, snow is replaced whenever it snowfalls. It is also produced by Snow Golems wherever they walk over. \n \n \n Spider Eye \n \n      \n Dropped by killed Spiders , Cave Spiders , and Witches . \n \n \n String \n \n                      \n Dropped by killed Spiders or Cave Spiders . \n \n \n Sugar Cane \n \n              \n Will grow to 3 blocks high and can be trimmed or replanted. Must first be found in the world, and can only be planted on dirt / sand bordering water . Can be sometimes found 4 blocks high in the world. Sugar is also dropped by killed Witches . \n \n \n Tall Grass \n \n  \n Bonemeal being used on grass blocks plants tall grass on the ground. To harvest tall grass, one must also use shears made from iron . \n \n \n Vines \n \n \xe2\x80\x94 \n Found on swamp trees, jungle trees, and on terrain and caves in jungles. When attached (hanging), they grow naturally if there is open space below. To harvest vines, one must also use shears made from iron . They also generate as part of player-made jungle trees. \n \n \n Water Bucket \n \n  \n Two water spring blocks in the appropriate pattern produce a third; see water for details. If placed in a snowy biome, it will create ice. \n \n \n Wool \n \n                  \n Obtained by killing or shearing sheep , crafting 4 strings dropped by Spiders or Cave Spiders , by breeding two sheep which will result in a child with the same color of wool as the parents, or by using shears on sheep. Six of the shown colors (white, light gray, gray, black, brown and pink) occur naturally in sheep; green, lime, red, orange and yellow wool require renewable dyes to produce. \n \n \n [ edit ] Rare drops \n These items are only occasionally dropped by monsters, so getting them quickly or in quantity is normally done by mining, then smelting/crafting non-renewable resources ( mob farms being an option). \n \n \n Resource \n Products produced \n Method to Obtain \n \n \n Bows \n \n  \n Bows are rarely dropped by skeletons , and can be enchanted with Power I and with an even more rare chance a Power II Bow followed by secondary enchantments. Usually, one would rather craft a bow with renewable sticks and strings . \n \n \n Chainmail Armor \n    \n \xe2\x80\x94 \n Can very rarely be found equipped to Zombies , Zombie Pigmen , and Skeletons . Can also be found being sold by Villagers . \n \n \n Diamond Armor \n    \n \xe2\x80\x94 \n Obtained by trading with villager blacksmiths. However, this is also a rare drop because about 1 in 50 000 zombies have diamond armor. [ citation&#160;needed ] \n \n \n Gold Nuggets and Gold Ingots \n  \n                      \n Nuggets are dropped by killed zombie pigmen , ingots as a rare drop. \n \n \n Gold Swords and Gold Armor \n    \n \xe2\x80\x94 \n Sword is a rare drop of killed zombie pigmen .

The health and hunger bars, as well as the hotbar, are visible. \n \n \n  This article is about the game mode. For other uses, see Survival (disambiguation) . \n Survival mode is the game mode of Minecraft in which players must collect resources, build structures, battle mobs , maintain hunger , and explore the land in an effort to survive. \n In Survival, players have an inventory in which they may gather items . These items may be combined using certain recipes to create tools and other items. This process is known as crafting . Most crafting recipes need a crafting table . Players are also able to create potions by brewing . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Survival single player (SSP) \n \n 1.1 Aim of the game \n \n \n 2 Survival multiplayer (SMP) \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Bugs \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ]  Survival single player (SSP) \n Survival single player is the original game mode of Minecraft . Until mid-Alpha, SSP was the only available mode besides Classic creative mode. SSP may be played online or offline, as long as the user has initially played it while connected to the Internet (which allows game files to download to their computer). \n [ edit ] Aim of the game \n Despite being marketed as a game with no pre-determined goals, Minecraft does offer a proper ending when played in Survival mode by defeating the Ender Dragon . However when you reach The Nether the player has the option of: 1. Finding a Nether Fortress and using Wither Skeleton heads to create a Wither , or 2. Making Eyes of Ender and using these to go to The End to defeat the Ender Dragon. Choosing to attempt the Wither boss first proves more rewarding as the player can then make beacons and use them to help defeat overworld mobs - usually via grinders. Although one can take a beacon to fight the dragon, it (along with it\'s support blocks) will be frequently destroyed by the passing dragon. \n \n The player starts in The Overworld where they must learn to survive using the player\'s intuition. \n The player must search caves or ravines for specific items to survive their first night. \n The player crafts their first tools which, under most (although not all) circumstances, will be a wooden pickaxe . This is then used to acquire stone tools. \n The player builds a home featuring a bed , chests full of spare materials, a crafting table , and a furnace . \n The player successfully finds a cave, canyon, or large underground opening which contains large deposits of usable minerals. \n The player finds and smelts iron ore into iron ingots and uses it for tools, or, if they acquire enough, possibly (but not necessarily) armor . \n The player strikes diamonds ! While looking for diamonds it is important the player keep a level head as to their surroundings, for in large caves there are usually many enemy mobs that can hunt down the player, so a few swords , a full set of armor and many torches are usually necessary. \n The player mines some obsidian . If not found, obsidian can be created by crafting a bucket , filling it with water , and pouring it into stationary lava . \n The player builds a portal to The Nether with the newly acquired obsidian. \n The player appears in the dimension The Nether; a new world bereft of minerals which poses new, scary threats to the player: Zombie Pigmen , Magma Cubes , Ghasts , Blazes , and Wither Skeletons . \n The player finds a Nether Fortress and finds the blaze spawner and attacks the Blazes, killing them and collecting their Blaze Rods from their defeat for use in potion brewing and to access the last challenge. \n The player navigates safely and successfully through The Nether and returns to The Overworld where their job is to find Endermen and kill them to obtain their Ender Pearls . \n The player constructs a peculiar item with unusual ghostly properties called an Eye of Ender , which when thrown will direct the player to the Stronghold they must go and find. \n Twelve Eyes of Ender must be kept with you when you find the Stronghold . This is important. \n Once the player finds the portal and the player has put the 12 Eyes of Ender in place, the portal into The End will open and you will now meet your destiny. \n Once their most worthy adversary, the legendary Ender Dragon , has been beaten, a story will scroll and credits will roll and then, and only then, the player will be teleported to their spawn location. (You can press ESC if you want to skip the story and credits, but read the story.) \n After you beat the game, you can explore the world, make a mineshaft underground, enlarge your house, defeat enemy mobs, and eat porkchops to your ever-growing imagination in the world of Minecraft . \n An optional thing to do is to kill the Wither to make a beacon so you can have some perks in a distance. \n \n [ edit ]  Survival multiplayer (SMP) \n \n See also: Multiplayer \n \n Survival multiplayer is played by users who connect to a central Minecraft server . This enables them to interact with other users. \n The command to toggle a player\'s game mode (survival, adventure or creative) in multiplayer (must be operator in order to use this command) is: \n \n/gamemode [0/1/2] [player\'s name]\n \n (0 for survival, 1 for creative, 2 for adventure) \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n This game mode was introduced on 4 th of August, 2009 in Survival Test under Classic . During this time, players experienced permadeath, meaning they could not respawn and the level needed to be restarted unless a save file had been created. \n The inventory and crafting was only introduced in the Indev version while the Infdev version features infinite map generation. This version also drops the permadeath feature allowing the player to respawn . The Alpha version improved the map generation by introducing biomes . \n The Multiplayer variant of this game mode also took place in the Alpha version. Originally, Notch had only allowed a limited number of people from the Minecraft IRC channel to participate in the first tests of SMP. These invitees could invite other people to test out this mode; however the password was leaked and the server was quickly filled up. Notch released the first version of the SMP server software on the 4th of August, 2010. The client was updated so that players could enter the IP of a server to join it. \n As of version 1.3, SSP was abolished in a technical sense. Instead, the player hosts a server that they can either close or open to others at any time. This change was intended to reduce the labor required to fix bugs for two different parts of Minecraft, at a slight performance cost. \n [ edit ] Bugs \n \n Main article: Known bugs \n \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Survival&amp;oldid=499230 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Gameplay Game modes  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 30 June 2013, at 06:40. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

For data values found in Classic , see Data values (Classic) . For data values found in Pocket Edition , see Data values (Pocket Edition) . \n These data values refer to the different types of blocks and items. They are used in many, many places in Minecraft. Block IDs are used to define blocks placed in the world and inventory items (including items in chests and items dropped in the world). Item IDs are only valid for items. Each inventory slot has a unique slot number. Block data further defines blocks placed, describing for example the height of water or the direction a torch points. \n \n \n \n  \nPicture reference. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 IDs \n \n 1.1 Block IDs \n 1.2 Item IDs \n 1.3 Entity IDs \n \n 1.3.1 Horse Variants \n \n \n 1.4 Biome IDs \n 1.5 Enchantment IDs \n 1.6 Status effects \n \n \n 2 Data \n \n 2.1 Wood Planks \n 2.2 Saplings \n 2.3 Water and Lava \n 2.4 Wood \n 2.5 Leaves \n 2.6 Wool \n 2.7 Torches and Redstone Torches \n 2.8 Slabs and Double Slabs \n 2.9 Fire \n 2.10 Sandstone \n 2.11 Beds \n 2.12 Grass \n 2.13 Piston \n 2.14 Piston Extension \n 2.15 Stairs \n 2.16 Redstone Wire \n 2.17 Crops \n 2.18 Farmland \n 2.19 Sign Posts \n 2.20 Door \n \n 2.20.1 Minecraft 1.1 and Earlier \n 2.20.2 Starting at Minecraft 1.2 (from weekly snapshot 12w06a) \n \n \n 2.21 Rails \n 2.22 Ladders, Wall Signs, Furnaces, and Chests \n 2.23 Dispensers, Droppers, and Hoppers \n 2.24 Levers \n 2.25 Pressure Plates \n 2.26 Buttons \n 2.27 Snow \n 2.28 Cactus \n 2.29 Sugar Cane \n 2.30 Jukebox \n 2.31 Pumpkins and Jack \'o\' Lanterns \n 2.32 Cake \n 2.33 Redstone Repeater \n 2.34 Trapdoors \n 2.35 Monster Egg \n 2.36 Stone Brick \n 2.37 Huge brown and red mushroom \n 2.38 Pumpkin stem and Melon stem \n 2.39 Vines \n 2.40 Fence Gates \n 2.41 Nether Wart \n 2.42 Brewing Stand \n 2.43 Cauldron \n 2.44 End Portal block \n 2.45 Cocoas \n 2.46 Tripwire Hook \n 2.47 Tripwire \n 2.48 Cobblestone Walls \n 2.49 Flower Pots \n 2.50 Heads \n 2.51 Block of Quartz \n 2.52 Coal \n 2.53 Dyes \n 2.54 Anvil \n 2.55 Potions \n \n 2.55.1 "Potion name" bits \n 2.55.2 "Potion effect" bits \n 2.55.3 "Tier" bit \n 2.55.4 "Extended duration" bit \n 2.55.5 "Splash potion" bit \n \n \n 2.56 Spawn Eggs \n 2.57 Golden Apple \n \n \n 3 Trivia \n 4 JSON Data Values \n 5 References \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] IDs \n [ edit ] Block IDs \n These values apply to both inventory items and to blocks placed in the world.

Entries marked with a D require additional data to fully define the item in a world. The chainmail set is currently obtainable in Survival mode via Villager trading, rare mob drop (armored zombie or skeleton ), hacking, or the /give server command.

All normal horses are of Type 0, donkeys are of Type 1, mules are of Type 2, undead horses are of Type 3, and skeletal horses are of Type 4. Below is a list of Variant values that determine the variant of Type 0 horses (horse entities of other types seem to ignore the Variant field). \n \n \n \n White \n Creamy \n Chestnut \n Brown \n Black \n Gray \n Dark Brown \n \n \n None \n 0 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n \n \n White \n 256 \n 257 \n 258 \n 259 \n 260 \n 261 \n 262 \n \n \n White Field \n 512 \n 513 \n 514 \n 515 \n 516 \n 517 \n 518 \n \n \n White Dots \n 768 \n 769 \n 770 \n 771 \n 772 \n 773 \n 774 \n \n \n Black Dots \n 1024 \n 1025 \n 1026 \n 1027 \n 1028 \n 1029 \n 1030 \n \n \n Variant names taken from the names of the texture file they correspond to. \n Giving a Type 0 horse entity a Variant value not in this chart will result in an invisible horse (or at least one without a skin). \n [ edit ] Biome IDs \n Biomes have been present in Minecraft since the Halloween Update , and the Biome ID is included in the Anvil file format since Minecraft 1.2 . The Biome ID for worlds stored in the older McRegion file format is calculated on the fly, which could lead to a discrepancy between the earlier generated world, and the features (such as grass color, snow) based on the calculated biome IDs. \n \n \n Dec \n Biome \n \n \n 0 \n Ocean \n \n \n 1 \n Plains \n \n \n 2 \n Desert \n \n \n 3 \n Extreme Hills \n \n \n 4 \n Forest \n \n \n 5 \n Taiga \n \n \n 6 \n Swampland \n \n \n 7 \n River \n \n \n 8 \n Hell (Nether) \n \n \n 9 \n Sky (End) \n \n \n 10 \n Frozen Ocean \n \n \n 11 \n Frozen River \n \n \n 12 \n Ice Plains \n \n \n 13 \n Ice Mountains \n \n \n 14 \n Mushroom Island \n \n \n 15 \n Mushroom Island Shore \n \n \n 16 \n Beach \n \n \n 17 \n Desert Hills \n \n \n 18 \n Forest Hills \n \n \n 19 \n Taiga Hills \n \n \n 20 \n Extreme Hills Edge \n \n \n 21 \n Jungle \n \n \n 22 \n Jungle Hills \n \n \n -1 \n (Uncalculated) \n \n \n [ edit ] Enchantment IDs \n \n \n ID \n Enchantment \n Enchantable Item(s) \n \n \n 0 \n Protection \n Armor \n \n \n 1 \n Fire Protection \n Armor \n \n \n 2 \n Feather Falling \n Boots \n \n \n 3 \n Blast Protection \n Armor \n \n \n 4 \n Projectile Protection \n Armor \n \n \n 5 \n Respiration \n Helmets \n \n \n 6 \n Aqua Affinity \n Helmets \n \n \n 7 \n Thorns \n Armor \n \n \n 16 \n Sharpness \n Swords, Axes \n \n \n 17 \n Smite \n Swords, Axes \n \n \n 18 \n Bane of Arthropods \n Swords, Axes \n \n \n 19 \n Knockback \n Swords \n \n \n 20 \n Fire Aspect \n Swords \n \n \n 21 \n Looting \n Swords \n \n \n 32 \n Efficiency \n Pickaxes, Shovels, Axes, Shears \n \n \n 33 \n Silk Touch \n Pickaxes, Shovels, Axes, Shears \n \n \n 34 \n Unbreaking \n Any Item with Durability \n \n \n 35 \n Fortune \n Pickaxes, Shovels, Axes \n \n \n 48 \n Power \n Bow \n \n \n 49 \n Punch \n Bow \n \n \n 50 \n Flame \n Bow \n \n \n 51 \n Infinity \n Bow \n \n \n [ edit ] Status effects \n Used in /effect command. \n \n \n Icon \n Value \n Name \n In source code \n Particle color \n \n \n  \n 1 \n Speed \n potion.moveSpeed \n  0x7cafc6 \n \n \n  \n 2 \n Slowness \n potion.moveSlowdown \n  0x5a6c81 \n \n \n  \n 3 \n Haste \n potion.digSpeed \n  0xd9c043 \n \n \n  \n 4 \n Mining Fatigue \n potion.digSlowDown \n  0x4a4217 \n \n \n  \n 5 \n Strength \n potion.damageBoost \n  0x932423 \n \n \n - \n 6 \n Instant Health \n potion.heal \n  0xf82423 \n \n \n - \n 7 \n Instant Damage \n potion.harm \n  0x430a09 \n \n \n  \n 8 \n Jump Boost \n potion.jump \n  0x786297 \n \n \n  \n 9 \n Nausea \n potion.confusion \n  0x551d4a \n \n \n  \n 10 \n Regeneration \n potion.regeneration \n  0xcd5cab \n \n \n  \n 11 \n Resistance \n potion.resistance \n  0x99453a \n \n \n  \n 12 \n Fire Resistance \n potion.fireResistance \n  0xe49a3a \n \n \n  \n 13 \n Water Breathing \n potion.waterBreathing \n  0x2e5299 \n \n \n  \n 14 \n Invisibility \n potion.invisibility \n  0x7f8392 \n \n \n  \n 15 \n Blindness \n potion.blindness \n  0x1f1f23 \n \n \n  \n 16 \n Night vision \n potion.nightVision \n  0x1f1fa1 \n \n \n  \n 17 \n Hunger \n potion.hunger \n  0x587653 \n \n \n  \n 18 \n Weakness \n potion.weakness \n  0x484d48 \n \n \n  \n 19 \n Poison \n potion.poison \n  0x4e9331 \n \n \n  \n 20 \n Wither \n potion.wither \n  0x352a27 \n \n \n  \n 21 \n Health Boost \n potion.healthBoost \n  0xf87d23 \n \n \n  \n 22 \n Absorption \n potion.absorption \n  0x2552a5 \n \n \n  \n 23 \n Saturation \n potion.saturation \n  0xf82423 \n \n \n [ edit ] Data \n Special data for certain block and item types.

At this level, the lower bits are essentially ignored, since this block is then at its highest fluid level. \n The lower three bits are the fluid block\'s level. 0x0 is the highest fluid level (not necessarily filling the block - this depends on the neighboring fluid blocks above each upper corner of the block). Data values increase as the fluid level of the block drops: 0x1 is next highest, 0x2 lower, on through 0x7, the lowest fluid level. Along a line on a flat plane, water drops one level per meter from the source, lava drops one in the nether and two everywhere else. \n The stationary versions of each fluid are "stable" and currently not being checked by the engine for further level changes. \n [ edit ] Wood \n \n \n \n Data value \n description \n \n \n Dec \n Hex \n Binary \n \n \n  \n 0 \n 0 \n 0000 \n Oak wood facing up/down \n \n \n  \n 1 \n 1 \n 0001 \n Spruce wood facing up/down \n \n \n  \n 2 \n 2 \n 0010 \n Birch wood facing up/down \n \n \n  \n 3 \n 3 \n 0011 \n Jungle wood facing up/down \n \n \n  \n 4 \n 4 \n 0100 \n Oak wood facing East/West \n \n \n  \n 5 \n 5 \n 0101 \n Spruce wood facing East/West \n \n \n  \n 6 \n 6 \n 0110 \n Birch wood facing East/West \n \n \n  \n 7 \n 7 \n 0111 \n Jungle wood facing East/West \n \n \n  \n 8 \n 8 \n 1000 \n Oak wood facing North/South \n \n \n  \n 9 \n 9 \n 1001 \n Spruce wood facing North/South \n \n \n  \n 10 \n A \n 1010 \n Birch wood facing North/South \n \n \n  \n 11 \n B \n 1011 \n Jungle wood facing North/South \n \n \n  \n 12 \n C \n 1100 \n Oak wood with only bark \n \n \n  \n 13 \n D \n 1101 \n Spruce wood with only bark \n \n \n  \n 14 \n E \n 1110 \n Birch wood with only bark \n \n \n  \n 15 \n F \n 1111 \n Jungle wood with only bark \n \n \n [ edit ] Leaves \n If bit 0x4 is set, the leaves are permanent and will never decay.

Brick slabs and stone brick slabs were added in Beta 1.8. \n Wooden slabs as a separate block with wooden properties, rather than a retextured stone slab, was introduced in Weekly Release 12w17a, with each of the four plank types included. The wooden stone slab is still available through inventory hacks or the /give command. \n [ edit ] Fire \n 0x0 is a placed or spread fire. Once it reaches 0xF the eternal fire-trick will work since there will be no further updates of the block. \n [ edit ] Sandstone \n For normal sandstone the bottom has a cracked pattern.

For powered rails, 0x8 is a bit flag; if set, the rail is powered. The bottom three bits have a valid range of 0x0 to 0x5. \n \n 0x0: flat track going north-south \n 0x1: flat track going west-east \n 0x2: track ascending to the east \n 0x3: track ascending to the west \n 0x4: track ascending to the north \n 0x5: track ascending to the south \n \n Regular minecart tracks can make a circle from four rails: \n \n 0x6: northwest corner (connecting east and south) \n 0x7: northeast corner (connecting west and south) \n 0x8: southeast corner (connecting west and north) \n 0x9: southwest corner (connecting east and north) \n \n [ edit ] Ladders , Wall Signs , Furnaces , and Chests \n \n 0x2: Facing north (for ladders and signs, attached to the north side of a block) \n 0x3: Facing south \n 0x4: Facing west \n 0x5: Facing east \n \n [ edit ] Dispensers , Droppers , and Hoppers \n Same as ladders, signs, etc. above and additionally: \n \n 0x0: Facing Down \n 0x1: Facing Up (or unattached to any container for Hoppers) \n \n [ edit ] Levers \n \n 0x8: If this bit is set, the lever has been thrown and is providing power. \n \n Wall levers: \n \n 0x1: Facing east \n 0x2: Facing west \n 0x3: Facing south \n 0x4: Facing north \n \n Ground levers: \n \n 0x5: Lever points south when off. \n 0x6: Lever points east when off.

The remaining two bits (0x3) describe in which direction the gate is facing. The fence gate swings open away from you. The direction in which you are looking when you stand in front of the open fence gate is the direction in which the gate is facing. \nThe facing-bit directions are: \n \n 0: To the south \n 1: To the west \n 2: To the north \n 3: To the east \n \n [ edit ] Nether Wart \n Like Crops, the data value is related to the size of the Nether Wart.

To make the frame activate, each of the portal frame blocks in the pattern must "face" toward the middle. Since the image is near-symmetrical, it is difficult to tell which direction an individual block is actually facing, but if the block isn\'t facing in that direction and that is the last frame block where the Eye of Ender is placed, the frame won\'t activate. \n Direction vectors for the blocks are the following: \n \n 0: To the south \n 1: To the west \n 2: To the north \n 3: To the east \n \n 0x4 is a bit flag: 0 is an "empty" frame block, 1 is a block with an Eye of Ender inserted. \n [ edit ]  Cocoas \n The top two bits, 0xC, specify the size of the plant. \n \n 0x0: small \n 0x4: medium \n 0x8: large \n \n Combination 0xC (both bits set) is not used, and results in a cocoa pod which is larger than the normal largest one, and uses the enderdragon egg texture. \n The bottom two bits define which direction the plant is facing out, i.e. to what side of the tree the plant is attached. \n \n 0x0: Facing north (i.e., attached to the north side of the tree) \n 0x1: Facing east \n 0x2: Facing south \n 0x3: Facing west \n \n [ edit ] Tripwire Hook \n \n 0x4: This bit means the tripwire hook is connected and ready to trip ("middle" position) \n 0x8: This bit means the tripwire hook is currently activated ("down" position) \n \n An activated hook will normally have a value of 0xC, meaning "connected" and "activated". \n The two low bits determine to which wall the hook is attached: \n \n 0x0: Facing south \n 0x1: Facing west \n 0x2: Facing north \n 0x3: Facing east \n \n [ edit ] Tripwire \n \n 0x4: This bit means the tripwire as a whole has been activated. \n 0x1: This bit means some object is on this particular piece of tripwire. \n \n So, unactivated tripwire has a value of 0x0. \n Connection is determined by the neighboring tripwire, similar to redstone wiring. \n [ edit ] Cobblestone Walls \n \n \n Icon \n Value \n Description \n \n \n  \n 0 \n Cobblestone \n \n \n  \n 1 \n Moss Stone \n \n \n [ edit ] Flower Pots \n \n \n Icon \n Value \n Description \n \n \n  \n 0 \n empty \n \n \n  \n 1 \n Rose \n \n \n  \n 2 \n Dandelion \n \n \n  \n 3 \n Oak Sapling \n \n \n  \n 4 \n Spruce Sapling \n \n \n  \n 5 \n Birch Sapling \n \n \n  \n 6 \n Jungle Tree Sapling \n \n \n  \n 7 \n Red Mushroom \n \n \n  \n 8 \n Brown Mushroom \n \n \n  \n 9 \n Cactus \n \n \n  \n 10 \n Dead Bush \n \n \n  \n 11 \n Fern \n \n \n [ edit ] Heads \n Note: Only part of the information for this block is in the data value, the rest in the associated Tile Entity.

This can cause a normal looking item to appear, but will be unusable and unstackable with an identical item that has a different data value. In the case of Wool colors, data values "rotate" when out of bounds. Examples are provided:\n \n Example 1 - Stacking : If the player were to type /give &lt;PLAYERNAME&gt; 351 1 1 , an Ink Sac would be given to the player like normal. However, if the player were to type /give &lt;PLAYERNAME&gt; 351 1 -4 afterward, another Ink Sac would be given, but it won\'t stack with the first Ink Sac, because the two Ink Sacs have different data values, despite the fact that both items appear to be the same thing. \n Example 2 - Value Defaults : Using the /give command to spawn an item with data values that are out of valid bounds will "default" to the lowest or highest valid data value closest to it. Typing /give &lt;PLAYERNAME&gt; 351 1 -23 will spawn an Ink Sac, due to -23 being closest to 0, the lowest possible valid data value for dye, being the Ink Sac. Typing /give &lt;PLAYERNAME&gt; 351 1 43 will spawn Bone Meal, because 43 is closest to the dye\'s highest valid data value, being 15, which is what Bone Meal is. \n Example 3 - Non-usable : Note that the valid data values for dye are between the numbers 0 and 15. Any type of dye that\'s spawned with an data value lower than 0 or higher than 15 cannot be used. So if one is using the /give command to spawn a dye with an data value of 32, which would spawn Bone Meal, the said Bone Meal can not be used to mix with other dyes or be used as a quick plant growing agent. \n Example 4 - Rotation : data value rotation has been confirmed for Wool, but only the colors seem to rotate. Using a Wool data value of 16 (when the highest is 15) (fun fact: the wool data value of 16 is shown as nether warts, but when placed by the player it becomes white wool) will "circle back" to white wool, which is 0. Using an data value of 18 will circle back to Magenta Wool, because 18 is 3 integers higher than the max of 15, it will circle back to 0, but the extra 3 bumps it to the data value of 2. Despite this, the unstacking data value issue still remains. \n \n \n \n [ edit ] JSON Data Values \n \n Web/Plugin/App Developers looking for a JSON representation of the minecraft data values and PNG images can use the free api at: http://api.mineverse.com (Free registration required to prevent abuse).

In order to craft something, players must move items from their inventory to a crafting grid. A 2\xc3\x972 crafting grid can be accessed from the player\'s inventory. A 3\xc3\x973 grid can be accessed by right-clicking a Crafting Table . \n For some items, the arrangement of their ingredients on the crafting grid is unimportant. These are commonly known as shapeless recipes. For example, a Fermented spider eye can have its ingredients placed anywhere within the grid. \n On the other hand, many of the more important or useful game objects must have their ingredients placed in the correct relative positions on the crafting grid. Even then, provided the resources are arranged correctly, the item can be made in any way that fits in the grid. For example, a 3\xc3\x971 recipe, such as bread , can be made using the top, middle, or bottom row of the 3\xc3\x973 grid, but it cannot be made using the 2\xc3\x972 grid because it needs to be three items wide. Ingredients in \'shaped\' recipes can be \'slid\' up, down, left, or right. They can also be flipped horizontally. For instance, players can make a bow with the strings placed on the right instead of on the left. \n Players always have access to the 2\xc3\x972 crafting grid from their Inventory screen, and this can be used whenever the screen is brought up. Crafting recipes that are at most 2\xc3\x972 can always be made there. These include wood planks , sticks , and crafting tables. To craft items using a 3\xc3\x973 grid, create a crafting table, place it in any convenient spot, and right-click it. This brings up a pop-up screen with a 3\xc3\x973 grid on which the player can assemble any crafting recipe in the game. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 MATTIS \n 2 Xbox 360 crafting system \n 3 Item durability \n 4 Complete recipe list \n \n 4.1 Basic recipes \n 4.2 Manufactured recipes \n 4.3 Transportation recipes \n 4.4 Tool recipes \n 4.5 Weapon recipes \n 4.6 Armor recipes \n 4.7 Mechanism recipes \n 4.8 Food recipes \n 4.9 Miscellaneous recipes \n 4.10 Dye recipes \n 4.11 Wool recipes \n 4.12 Enchantment and brewing recipes \n \n \n 5 History \n 6 See also \n 7 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] MATTIS \n In the Pocket Edition , crafting is somewhat different and uses the Minecraft Advanced Touch Technology Interface System (MATTIS) crafting system. Rather than having 2\xc3\x972 and 3\xc3\x973 grids, there are four categories down the left: Blocks, Tools, Food &amp; Armor, and Decoration. Tapping on each category brings up a list of items/blocks that are craftable from that menu. For each item, there is an area that lists the requirements. The first number is the amount of material collected; the second is the amount required. There is an item description under each item that says what the item is used for. All the player has to do is tap the desired item the same number of times as the desired number of that item. The newly created items show up in the inventory. Crafting is currently limited to survival mode only in PE, and is currently limited to a very small number of options. \n The player has the option to use a crafting table to give him/her many more choices. The player must first craft a crafting table. After the player taps the crafting table, the MATTIS pops up with crafting options. To craft bricks, stone bricks, stone-based slabs, or stone-based stairs, the player should build a Stonecutter . \n [ edit ] Xbox 360 crafting system \n The Xbox 360 Edition uses a simplified crafting system. It does not make use of the standard crafting interface, but still has similarities to the PC version\'s 2\xc3\x972 and 3\xc3\x973 crafting grids, making it a cross between the PC grid-based system and the Pocket Edition\'s MATTIS system. The interface does not require the player to place items in the correct place in a crafting menu, but instead simply displays the ingredients required to craft the selected item and allows the player to craft that item so long as the player has the required crafting ingredients. The crafting table orders all craftable items into eight categories: Structures , Tools , Weapons , Food , Armor , Mechanisms , Transportation , and Decoration . \n Pressing  opens the 2\xc3\x972 crafting menu. The Armor tab is missing here as crafting any armor requires the use of a 3\xc3\x973 crafting grid. \n [ edit ] Item durability \n \n Main article: Item durability \n \n Certain crafted items, like weapons, tools, and armor, have an item durability . Such items have a limited number of uses, after which they will break. Items made of harder materials such as iron or diamond will last longer, while those made of softer materials such as wood or gold will wear out more quickly. A small damage bar below each item shows roughly how much longer it will last before breaking. (Pressing F3 + H will make exact durabilities appear in the player\'s inventory tooltips.) Partially worn-out items can be repaired. The item repair process works by combining two damaged items to create a less-damaged one, and usually gives a small efficiency bonus compared to simply using items until they break. \n \nA use counts only if a player completely breaks apart one block or hits a mob. If a block is only partially broken, this does not count as a use. \n 1. Using a shovel , pickaxe , or axe on a mob (hostile, neutral, or farm animal) counts as two uses. \n 2. Using a sword on any mob or animal counts as one use. \n 3. Using a hoe on any mob or animal counts as zero uses. \n 4. Using a shovel, pickaxe, or axe to break a block counts as one use. \n 5. Using a sword to break a block counts as two uses. \n 6. Using a hoe to break blocks counts as zero uses. \n Proper use of tools will maximize their durability. Assuming a player uses a tool appropriately, the following list shows the maximum durability for tools of each material type: \n \n Wood - 60 uses \n Stone - 132 uses \n Iron - 251 uses \n Gold - 33 uses \n Diamond - 1,562 uses \n \n Note that even though gold tools have very low durability, they are the fastest among all the tools with no enchantments. However even with gold tools high efficiency, gold swords only have the same attack strength as wood swords (  ) \n \nThe amount of protection given by a piece of armor depends only on the material it is made of, and is not affected by the armor\'s remaining durability. \n See also: Tools#Item durability and Item durability . \n [ edit ] Complete recipe list \n \n Currently, there are: \n \n 6 Basic recipes \n 23 Manufactured recipes \n 10 Transportation recipes \n 13 Tool recipes \n 3 Weapon recipes \n 4 Armor recipes \n 20 Mechanism recipes \n 12 Food recipes \n 19 Miscellaneous recipes \n 12 Dye recipes \n 15 Wool recipes \n 9 Enchantment and brewing recipes \n \n This totals to 146 Crafting Recipes, excluding Firework recipes. \n To save space, some recipes are animated (requires JavaScript ).

Work had been done to the game so that players had a more controllable inventory: things could be picked up, dropped, and put wherever the player wanted them in the hot-bar or the inventory grid. This is vital to crafting, which relies on the movement of items around the inventory screen. Among the first few recipes were Sticks, Pickaxes, Torches, Swords, Axes, and Gold and Iron blocks. The next day, Indev was updated again with many other recipes. As new blocks and items were implemented into the game, new crafting recipes were made accordingly. \n Recipes had static placements until Beta version 1.2 was released on January 13, 2011. This introduced new recipes that allowed players to place ingredients wherever they wanted in the grid (dye + wool). \n In 1.8, the Adventure Update , crafting was given a very convenient mechanic. Holding shift while grabbing a crafting output would automatically take all possible outputs from the stock of ingredients it was given. \n Daniel Kaplan released preview images [1] [2] of the Minecraft Advanced Touch Technology Interface System (MATTIS) crafting system on April 17, 2012, and the system was implemented in Alpha 0.3.0 on April 24. \n A simplified crafting system for the Xbox 360 was implemented with the first version release (Beta 1.6.6). \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Brewing \n Enchanting \n Smelting \n \n Players can also create the following objects or entities, but they are constructed in the world, rather than crafted on a crafting table: \n \n Nether Portal \n Snow Golem \n Iron Golem \n Wither \n Double Chest \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n kappischetweet:192266848836919296 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.twitch.tv/kappische/ \n \n \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Crafting&amp;oldid=504128 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Gameplay Crafting  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t Portugu\xc3\xaas do Brasil \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 11 July 2013, at 04:02. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

Chickens are 0.875 blocks tall, 0.5 blocks wide and 0.8125 blocks long. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Appearance \n 2 Behavior \n 3 Breeding \n 4 Glitches \n 5 Chicks \n 6 Farming \n 7 History \n 8 Video \n 9 Trivia \n 10 Gallery \n 11 See also \n 12 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Appearance \n Chickens have white feathers and wings, yellow beaks, yellow feet and red wattles. Their texture is somewhat checkered, in a similar fashion to wool . They are about the size of a block , and, like other mobs, their baby form has a small body with a large head. \n [ edit ] Behavior \n \n While in a loaded chunk, a chicken lays one egg approximately every 7.5 minutes (6000 to 12000 ticks). \n They follow the player if they are holding wheat seeds , melon seeds , or pumpkin seeds . \n When a chicken falls from a ledge, it quickly flaps its wings and falls slowly to the ground to prevent fall damage. \n Chickens appear to wander around aimlessly, not even attempting to stay out of water. \n They are drawn to light in a dark environment. \n They flap their wings in water to keep above the surface. \n If burned to death they will drop cooked chicken. (With e.g. Flint and steel or Lava or flame enchantment.) \n \n [ edit ] Breeding \n \n Main article: Breeding \n \n There are two ways to breed chickens. This can be done by throwing eggs, which has a 1/8 to spawn a baby chicken; if it does, there is a 1/32 chance of spawning 4 chicks instead of one. It should be noted that if it is thrown at a wall, the chicken will spawn in the wall and likely suffocate, as seen in this diagram: \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Diagram of egg glitch. \n \n \n \n \n Chickens can also be bred like the other farm animals, by feeding adult chickens seeds of any sort. They can be bred with wheat seeds , melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, or even nether wart. The chickens that were fed will need to wait 5 minutes before they can breed again. \n Hatching chickens by throwing eggs, and breeding them with seeds, can be done simultaneously to multiply them much faster than other mobs. Baby chicks take 20 minutes to mature. Like all other baby animals, they do not drop resources and experience orbs when killed. (Nor do they lay eggs.) \n \n [ edit ] Glitches \n \n Chickens will fall through the ground over and over if they swim. This is a common glitch. \n \n \n Chickens can fall between piston sticks. \n \n \n Chickens falling through cobweb and landing in fire will not cook the chicken. Will result in Raw Chicken. \n \n [ edit ] Chicks \n Successfully breeding two chickens or breaking enough chicken eggs spawns a chick. \n \n Chicks move faster than adults. \n They take about 20 minutes to fully mature. \n As a chick, they do not lay eggs and do not drop resources/experience if killed, like any other baby mob. \n Chicks follow their parents or other adult chickens until they grow into an adult. \n Chicks can swim in water if they try. \n Chicks can drown in water 1 block deep or more. \n \n [ edit ] Farming \n Farming chickens is very useful, as it provides a renewable source of chicken eggs, raw/cooked chicken, feathers, and XP. As with other animals, you will want to keep them in an enclosed or fenced area so they don\'t wander off. The best Chicken farming technique would include a pit-type enclosure at least 2 blocks deep with a ladder out. (otherwise chickens escape every time you open the door or gate) Chicken farms can generate quite a bit of noise; you probably will want to build large farms at least sixteen blocks away from frequently used areas. \n Remember that ungathered eggs will vanish after 5 minutes\xe2\x80\x94merging stacks does extend that, but even so, if you\'re trying to build a large population you\'ll want to gather them several times a day. If a pen of chickens is abandoned (all chicks grow up, then eggs are not gathered for at least 5 minutes), the next egg harvest will average at least 70% of the number of chickens (hatching to about 83%). \n Automatic egg farms can be created by placing chickens in water arranged so as to support the chickens, while letting the eggs (and any drops from killed chickens) fall into a collection area. (beware that chicks can drown in water as of 1.5.1) \n In the Minecraft snapshot 13w01, hoppers were introduced. Putting one of these below the output of an egg farm automatically collects the eggs for you. Add a chest below that to store the eggs, or, if you are feeling creative, add an automatic dispenser below to turn the eggs back into chickens. Then wait for the chickens to age, and kill them automatically or manually. Some useful values: \n \n A single chest (or Minecart with chest ) full of eggs will yield an average of 59 chicks. \n Assuming a farm with automatic hatching, then later automatic collection of eggs, a given large number of eggs (say 1 chest, or 2 chests, etc. ) will take roughly 75 minutes to replace itself. This includes the 20 minutes for the chickens to grow to maturity, but not any time needed to actually hatch all those eggs. \n \n This video is a proper example of the new automatic farm possibilities after snapshot 13w01 with hoppers. \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.0.14 (Seecret Friday 7) \n Added chickens. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.0 \n Chickens can be made by throwing eggs. \n \n \n 1.8 \n Raw chicken is introduced with the hunger system . Before this, chickens dropped only feathers at death. \n \n \n 1.9pre2 \n Chickens can be bred. At this time, they used wheat, like all passive mobs did. \n \n \n 1.9pre5 \n Baby chickens were added, along with other baby mobs. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.2.1 \n 12w04a \n Ocelots attack chickens. \n \n \n 12w07a \n Chickens have new AI system . \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w36a \n Chickens now use wheat seeds , melon seeds , pumpkin seeds and Nether Warts instead of wheat to breed. \n \n \n 12w38a \n Added new step sounds. \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n  \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n When a chicken is killed off a ledge, the "corpse" also falls more slowly than normal, and the wings still make a flapping animation. This also happens in Pocket Edition . \n Notch tweeted that he changed the chickens to ducks a few weeks before the end of Beta, [2] causing a turmoil on Twitter. A few days later, Jeb, still getting feedback on the idea, stated that it was just a joke. [3] \n If you throw chicken eggs at glass panes or iron bars , there is a small chance that the chick spawns on the opposite side. \n Despite being an animal that does not give live birth, chickens in-game are able to give live birth. \n Chickens are the only animals that can repopulate from only one animal. The eggs it drops can be hatched into additional chickens, which can then breed. \n There is no texture for the underside of a chicken\'s head, allowing you to see through it and see the inside. \n Ocelots attack chickens. \n When first released, chickens took fall damage like other mobs, and would drop leather if they died from it (bug). \n The baby chicken is so small it can fit through the gap of a stair block facing a full block. \n In Pocket Edition, adult chickens come out of eggs instead of baby chickens. \n Baby chickens are able to "hide" within hoppers due to their small size, protecting them from lava or water that is directly on top of the hopper. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A chick with its parents. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A "chicken tube" farm containing over 100 chickens. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A fresh chicken farm pit with newly hatched chicks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Fully grown chickens in a circle.

Different qualities of pickaxe are required to successfully harvest certain ores and blocks . For example, while stone can be mined with any pickaxe, gold ore must be mined with an iron pickaxe or better, or else the player will harvest no ore . Different pickaxes also mine many materials at different speeds (see the Speed and durability table below).

A pickaxe is the most important tool to go further in the game of Minecraft being almost impossible to complete the game without using it. Blocks minable by the pickaxe are listed in the table below . \n The pickaxe does one full heart less damage to mobs than the sword of the same material. \n A mnemonic for when to use the second-highest, Iron pick, to mine greater than-it ores, is "DGER" ("digger")&#160;: or "DiGoEmRe," that is to use at least Iron for mining Diamond, Gold, Emerald, and /or Redstone. Diamond picks will even (slowly) mine Obsidian. \n [ edit ] Speed and durability \n The following table shows the time it takes to break each type of block. \n \n A red background indicates that the block cannot be harvested with that tool. \n A yellow background indicates that the block cannot be harvested with that tool, but still drops something. \n A blue background indicates that the block can only be harvested with a tool that has the silk touch enchantment . \n \n \n \n \n Fists \n Wood \n Stone \n Iron \n Diamond \n Gold \n \n \n Durability \n \xe2\x88\x9e \n 60 \n 132 \n 251 \n 1562

\n Before, the pickaxe had much less durability (usually half as much). Also before this update, Gold pickaxes acted like wooden ones. \n \n \n 1.9pre6 \n Obsidian is quicker to mine (from 15 to 10 seconds). \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0.0 \n Pickaxes and other tools make a sound when they break. \n \n \n 1.3 \n Before, it was impossible to obtain Ice , even with Silk Touch. \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Foam Iron pickaxes are official Minecraft merchandise. [1] \n It is sometimes possible to complete the game without using it, e.g. by using TNT and creepers for mining (and perhaps getting iron by killing golems), and making the nether portal by casting it in place; but doing all that without using the pickaxe to mine anything, and finding a stronghold without it, is extremely tedious and remarkably dangerous due to limited resources. Some players take this as a challenge to their knowledge of alternative ways to advance in-game. \n In the game Naughty Bear: Panic in Paradise , you can buy a diamond pickaxe which, according to the game, is made by Kick it up a Notch Pickaxes, referring to Notch. \n In the game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim , you can find, a pickaxe called the "Notched Pickaxe", evidently an easter egg. \n In the game Offensive Combat , a stone pickaxe can be used as a melee weapon with the name of "The Notch Carver". \n In the game "The Binding of Isaac", an obtainable item named "Notched Axe", also with a drawn 8-bit look, can be used to destroy rocks. \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.jinx.com/p/minecraft_foam_pick_axe.html?catid=&amp;s=minecraft \n \n \n \n Items [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Items/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Pickaxe&amp;oldid=502876 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Category : Tools  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Italiano \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 8 July 2013, at 12:26. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

There are also Glass Panes . Glass blocks can be crafted by smelting a block of sand or obtained through trading with villagers . It has an almost completely transparent texture put on all six sides of the block. Glass blocks adjacent to other glass blocks are invisible when viewed through glass. \n Glass will not hinder a redstone current from traveling down the side of a block diagonal to it . \n Redstone Wire , Jack \'o\' Lanterns , Rails , Doors , Pressure Plates , Beds , Trapdoors and Ladders cannot be placed on (or against, for trapdoors and ladders) glass. Torches and Redstone Torches can be placed on top of glass blocks, but not attached to their sides.Glass can be re-obtained by a tool with Silk Touch. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Smelting \n 2 As a crafting ingredient \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Issues \n 6 Trivia \n 7 See also \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Smelting \n \n \n Ingredients \n Smelting \n \n \n Sand \n \n \n \n    \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] As a crafting ingredient \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Glass \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n   16  \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n   3  \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Glass + \n Nether Quartz + \n Wooden Slabs \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Glass + \n Nether Star + \n Obsidian \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Classic \n \n \n 0.0.18a_02 \n Glass was added for testing. \n \n \n 0.0.19a \n  Glass was officially added and used to have the old texture. \n \n \n 0.0.19a_06 \n The Glass texture was changed. \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.0.5 \n Snow no longer passes through glass. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.5_01 \n Rain no longer falls through translucent blocks like glass. \n \n \n 1.6 \n When placing water above glass it no longer breaks the creation of an infinite water source. \n \n \n 1.8 \n Added Glass Panes . \n \n \n 1.9pre3 \n Added Glass Bottles . \n \n \n Glass pillars were added on top of strongholds.

Report issues there. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Glass blocks do not reduce the intensity of the light passing through it, aside from the normal decrease of -1. See Opacity . \n Rain and snow cannot be seen through glass that is being broken. \n Snow does not accumulate on glass. \n If you try to light glass on fire with a flint and steel no flames will appear, but the flint and steel will still act as if it had been used (its durability will decrease slightly). The same thing happens with ice. \n Placing a glass block on top of a chest does not prevent the chest from being opened. \n Glass towers can create light underwater via sunlight. \n Glass placed next to water running downwards will make the water run more quickly and violently; this can be useful in making traps . \n When Glass is placed over a dropped item, the item is trapped inside the glass but can be retrieved normally. \n Mobs (excluding Zombies , Spiders and Slimes ) cannot draw line of sight through glass. \n Narrow (1x1) towers of glass which mark Strongholds can be naturally found in worlds generated in Beta 1.9pre3. This is not a bug, but a debug feature which Jeb forgot to remove. [1] \n The texture for Glass does not support partial transparency as Ice does. If the Ice texture is applied to Glass then many of the blocks behind the Glass become invisible and you see The Void . \n Hostile and passive mobs are unable to spawn on Glass, regardless of the light level . \n Glass can be picked up using a tool with the silk touch enchantment. \n While glass panes are more commonly used for windows, glass blocks are usually used for curved glass structures, such as domes. \n In Survival test Glass could be broken very quickly and would drop a glass block to pick up. The only way to obtain glass blocks at that time was to place them on the map before the level was loaded in the client . \n \n \n when riding a mine cart and a glass block exists one block above the ground only, a player can ride through the glass in a mine cart. This can be used to make a structure that you can ride into without a mob being able to enter the structure. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Sand \n Glass Pane \n Glass Bottle \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n jebtweet:121951968389369857 \n \n \n \n Blocks [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Blocks/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Glass&amp;oldid=503127 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Blocks Manufactured blocks  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t Portugu\xc3\xaas do Brasil \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 9 July 2013, at 00:06. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

Together, they build up the in-game environment, and can be mined and utilized in various fashions. There are one hundred and fifty three different blocks. \n The face of a block is 16\xc3\x9716 pixels, and each block is proportionately one cubic meter. [1] Most blocks are static, although water , lava , portal , and fire blocks have a shifting pattern for each face. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 World-generated blocks \n \n 1.1 The Overworld \n \n 1.1.1 Naturally generated \n 1.1.2 Naturally created \n 1.1.3 Structures \n \n \n 1.2 The Nether \n \n 1.2.1 Naturally generated \n 1.2.2 Naturally created \n 1.2.3 Structures \n \n \n 1.3 The End \n \n 1.3.1 Naturally generated \n 1.3.2 Naturally created \n \n \n \n \n 2 Block height \n 3 History \n 4 Bugs \n 5 See also \n 6 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] World-generated blocks \n Entries marked with a D require additional data values to fully define the block in a Minecraft world.

Operators of servers could also build Bedrock .

This also happens with doors. People with particularly low-end hardware may even experience three blocks being placed or removed with one click of the mouse. A good way of combating this problem is by reducing the render distance or by using mods like optifine to change the game settings and speed up the game. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Data values \n Opacity \n Light \n Items \n Ore \n Technical blocks \n Generated structures \n Altitude \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://notch.tumblr.com/post/422515389/clearing-up-the-world-size-math \n \n \n \n \n Blocks [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Blocks/content \n \n \n \n \n Environment [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Environment/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Blocks&amp;oldid=504063 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Blocks Environment  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t Italiano \n\t\t\t \xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t Portugu\xc3\xaas do Brasil \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 10 July 2013, at 23:12. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

(Torch added by player to prevent mob spawning.) \n \n \n Dungeons are naturally generated structures that appear in the Overworld . \n They are small rooms made of Cobblestone and Moss Stone and contain a hostile Mob Spawner and up to 2 Chests . Finding a dungeon without a chest is very unlikely, but possible. Occasionally, a dungeon will spawn with its chests in such a way as to create a double chest . Dungeons generate with either a zombie , skeleton , or spider spawner that can easily be deactivated by placing torches all around the spawner. \n Anyone exploring a cavern should be wary of encountering a dungeon, as they are almost always connected to large caverns. Also, a dungeon generated near the surface of a desert biome will cause sand to collapse and form a square depression. This can be a good way for inexperienced players to locate a dungeon and the resources associated with them. \n Dungeons do exist on Peaceful mode, as they are generated with the map. Monster Spawners will still spawn mobs in peaceful mode, but the mobs will instantly despawn. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Properties \n \n 1.1 Chest contents \n \n \n 2 Locating a dungeon \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Tips \n 6 Trivia \n 7 Gallery \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Properties \n A perfectly generated Dungeon, one which has not been overwritten by other generated terrain, will: \n \n Be 5x5, 5x7 or 7x7 of floor space in size \n Have cobblestone walls, and a mix of cobblestone and moss stone floor \n Have 0-2 chests \n Have a hostile monster spawner (these can be easily utilized by the player for mob farming) \n \n It is very likely for a dungeon to be overwritten by other generated terrain, thus distorting the dungeon. It is also possible, but rare, to find two dungeons joined together, with 2 spawners and 0-4 chests - although sometimes (even more rarely) triple dungeons can be found with 0-6 chests and 3 spawners. \n The mob spawner acts as a guard for the loot, spawning an indefinite number of mobs until the player can light up the room sufficiently to stop new mobs from being spawned, or simply break the spawner itself. This is usually accomplished by placing a torch on and around the spawner. The mob spawner is always in the center of the dungeon room, with chests located around the walls of the room (large chests can connect with the short side against the wall). The chests contain randomly generated treasure that are placed in random slots. \n A spawner in a dungeon has 50% chance of being a Zombie spawner, 25% chance of producing Skeletons , and 25% chance of producing Spiders . \n It is usually fairly easy to convert a dungeon to a "minifarm" for experience and drops, but the details will vary with the dungeon\'s location and environment. However, the spawner will not activate unless the player is standing within 15 blocks of it.(See Mob Spawner ) \n [ edit ] Chest contents \n Each dungeon chest block contains up to 8 item stacks, with the following distribution: \n \n \n Item stack \n Chance \nto spawn \n Chance of at least \none stack in a chest \n Number \nin one stack \n \n \n Saddle \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n Iron Ingot \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1-4 \n \n \n Bread \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n Wheat \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1-4 \n \n \n Gunpowder \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1-4 \n \n \n String \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1-4 \n \n \n Bucket \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n Enchanted Book \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 120 \n 6.5% \n 1 \n \n \n Redstone \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1-4 \n \n \n 13 disc \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n cat disc \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n Golden Apple (Normal) \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 120 \n 6.5% \n 1 \n \n \n Name Tag \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n Iron Horse Armor \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 24 \n 28.9% \n 1 \n \n \n Gold Horse Armor \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 60 \n 12.6% \n 1 \n \n \n Diamond Horse Armor \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 120 \n 6.5% \n 1 \n \n \n This information was obtained from Minecraft\'s code. The generation algorithm places one of these items in a random slot in the chest eight times, possibly overwriting items already placed. \n [ edit ] Locating a dungeon \n Dungeons can generate almost anywhere underground, but they are most common around Layer 26, and frequent between Layers 16 and 42. \n A reliable way of locating dungeons is through listening, either for a large amount of noise from one kind of mob, or for ambience . Neither of these things are an exclusive trait of a dungeon, but they do mean that there is an unlit and unexplored area nearby, which may well be a dungeon, particularly in the case of frequent, similar mob noises. \n Another good way of locating a dungeon is searching for moss stone inside of a cave, abandoned mine shafts , etc. this may be the fastest way to locate a dungeon. Another way is to look for newly placed cobblestone. \n Another way to find a dungeon is to look for fallen sand or gravel in a square pattern. \n Very rarely, dungeons will spawn in the side of a mountain making them easy to spot but hard to safely reach. \n Finally, pushing glowstone (or TNT) into the same block as the player\'s head using a piston will allow them to see through walls. If the player spots a cuboid area underground using this method, chances are it\'s a dungeon! \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Infdev \n \n \n Seecret Friday Update 2 \n Added dungeons. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.4 \n Added cocoa beans to dungeons. \n \n \n 1.7 \n Dungeons look different due to the cobblestone texture change. \n \n \n 1.8 \n Bread can appear in groups of 2, because food became stackable in 1.8 \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.3 \n 12w22a \n Breaking the spawner of a dungeon gives experience. \n \n \n 1.4.6 \n 12w49a \n Added enchanted books to dungeons. \n \n \n 1.6 \n 13w16b \n Added name tags and horse armor to dungeons. \n \n \n [ edit ] Tips \n \n To defeat a dungeon, aside from the obvious method of fighting the monsters and lighting up the area, one can instead tunnel underneath it and destroy the spawner from below. \n It is also possible to dig a tunnel above the dungeon and flood the area with lava, kill all of the mobs, then place torches to disable the spawner just as the last of the lava disappears. You can fill the entire dungeon with sand and/ or gravel. When the blocks that gravity applies to fall on top of the mobs, they will be crushed and killed. Once the room is filled, you can dig out the chest and loot it. You can also set a block of TNT above the spawner and prime the TNT, but doing so will destroy the spawner, and the dungeon cannot be used as mob grinder. \n Digging around the sides of the dungeon will allow you to bypass the spawner and loot the chests directly without any risk of health loss. \n A fast way to collect loot from the chest is to destroy the chest rather than removing the items from it. This way you collect all loot as well as the chest. \n Torches can be placed directly on the monster spawner. Placing one on each side provides the same effect as placing a torch on the blocks adjacent to the spawner, without needing to be replaced when you mine the floor out for Moss Stone. \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n \n \n  \nA caved in surface dungeon. \n \n \n \n The spawner will drop 13-40 EXP when broken by the player \n Dungeons will still generate if the \'generate structures\' option is toggled to off, even though they are claimed not to by the in-game description. \n Dungeons are almost always connected to a cavern, and because the cavern can be as small as a single block of air, the dungeon could completely overwrite it, usually resulting in a dungeon with no entrance. \n Rarely, a mushroom will appear in a dungeon on mossy cobblestone. \n It is possible, though almost impossibly rare for a dungeon to be generated at bedrock level, thereby deleting the bedrock. In which case digging through the moss stone can lead into the Void . \n Rarely, on peaceful, a monster spawner may spawn a monster that plays its sound file before it can despawn. \n If a dungeon has fallen gravel or sand in it, then placing a torch on the spawner may not be sufficient to light up the entire area to prevent spawning. \n It is rarely possible for a player to find a dungeon with two spawners and up to 4 chests. This only occurs when a 5x5 dungeon spawns within a 7x7 dungeon, since the dungeon will remove any blocks from the walls or floor that open into a cave, the walls of the smaller dungeon will be removed, resulting in a 7x7 floor space with one spawner in the middle, and a second spawner adjacent or diagonally adjacent to the first. \n Double-chest dungeons as shown below may have chests that form a perpendicular barrier between the wall and spawner (an exception to this would be in 7x7 dungeons, in which the chest cannot reach the spawner): \n \n \n \n \xe2\x80\x83 \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Each block of the floor (including under the walls) has a 25% chance of being cobblestone, and a 75% chance of being moss stone. \n If a dungeon loads in two chunks and one regenerates (often causing a flat vertical wall), the dungeon can become partially generated. This can be found if one of the walls of the dungeon is not cobblestone, but rather stone. Sometimes, the partially generated dungeon will not have a spawner or a chest. Example of a partially generated dungeon \n The contents of chests in dungeons appear to be based on the world seed. \n If you are playing on peaceful in a skeleton dungeon, sometimes skeletons will shoot arrows before despawning. \n Many players consider skeleton dungeons as the hardest to conquer. However, an easy tactic to use is to let many (5-6 are recommended) skeletons to spawn. Then, simply run inside of the dungeon. Most of the skeletons will be in such a frenzy to hurt you that they will shoot each other, and eventually kill themselves. While they are doing this, spam torches on the walls, preventing further spawning. If you want, you can kill some of the skeletons on your own after you are finished with the torches. Armor (preferably iron at least) and a stone , iron , or diamond sword are recommended. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A double-chest generated in dungeon. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dungeons\' roofs are that of the cave, so it is possible for a gravel vein above the dungeon to fall into it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Five dungeons and 2 cave spider spawners close together in a mineshaft, cleared to show all 7 spawners (pre 1.4) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon found under a frozen ocean \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A double dungeon, the wall of the first acting as the entrance of the second. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dungeons can rarely be found open to the surface. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A double dungeon with three chests. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon exposed by a ravine. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon intersecting with an abandoned mineshaft. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon found by an End Portal room in a stronghold. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon in multiplayer (notice the monster spawner has a pig inside). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon found in the water. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon, stronghold and an Abandoned Mine Shaft in one area. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon located within a Bedrock Layer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon open to the surface. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A floating dungeon in a cave system. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon distorted by a cave system. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The cave dungeon spawns in can be even this small. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dungeon spawned aside the chest chamber of the temple.

For mob spawners, see Monster Spawner . For the player, see The Player . \n Spawning refers to players and mobs being created and placed in the game world. Players will respawn at their spawn point, or at the bed they last slept in upon death . Mobs will despawn upon death. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Player spawning \n 2 Animal spawning \n 3 Mob spawning \n \n 3.1 Notes \n \n \n 4 History \n 5 Issues \n 6 Other types of spawning \n 7 Despawning \n 8 Trivia \n 9 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Player spawning \n For a more precise explanation of player spawning in multiplayer, see: Spawn/Multiplayer Details . \n Since Minecraft version 1.3, players in both singleplayer and multiplayer will spawn, by default, anywhere within a 20x20 area centered at the world spawn point. An individual player can change their spawn point by merely lying in a bed\xe2\x80\x94they do not have to go to sleep (which can only happen if all players use a bed at the same time). \n On multiplayer servers, a 33x33 block area centered at the default spawn point, and spanning the full height of the map, is "protected". Players, other than server operators , cannot place or destroy blocks in the protected area, use doors, activate switches other than pressure plates , or open chests or other blocks which contain items. Creepers can still destroy terrain in the protected area and TNT placed outside of the protected area will destroy surrounding blocks as usual. Along with this, portals from the nether can connect to the protected area, water/lava/fire can spread from outside into the protected area, and pistons can push items inside as well. Players can place blocks on the edge of the protected area if placed against the side of a block on the outside of the area. However, if the edges of the protected area are avoided, small, indestructible structures can be built. Paintings that are put up can be removed by players in the safe zone. \n [ edit ] Animal spawning \n Approximately one in ten newly generated chunks will contain mobs , usually in packs of up to four of the same species. They will always spawn on the highest available block in a column i.e. the one that can see the sky. For an animal to spawn on it, this block must be opaque and the two blocks above it must be transparent. The block does not need to be grass nor does it need to be illuminated (as it does with Mob Spawning ). \n Animals do not spawn in desert or ocean biomes , with the exception of squid . \n \n \n \n  \nA cow that generated with the map inside a tree\'s leaves and could not escape, a common sight in forested hill areas. \n \n \n Randomness for animal spawning is derived from the world seed , which means that worlds with the same seed will generate chunks with the same animals in the same places. \n Very rarely, new animals can spawn in already generated chunks, just like monsters do . When animals spawn in this way, they do so only on grass blocks with light level 9 or greater above them. This is also a requirement for animals spawning from monster spawners . Unlike monsters, animals do not spontaneously despawn , except for wild ocelots and wolves (which can despawn only when they are hostile). \n [ edit ] Mob spawning \n Mobs are broadly divided into four categories: hostile, friendly, water (i.e. Squid ) and ambient (i.e. Bat ). Hostile mobs have a spawning cycle once every game tick (1/20th of a second). Friendly and water mobs have only one spawning cycle every 400 ticks (20 seconds). Because of this, hostile mobs can spawn at any time, but animals spawn very rarely. Instead, most animals spawn within chunks when they are generated. \n Mobs spawn naturally within a 15x15 chunk (240x240 block) area around the player. When there are multiple players, mobs can spawn within this distance of any of them. However, mobs that move farther than 128 blocks from any player will immediately despawn (see Despawning ), so the mob spawning area is effectively limited to spheres with a radius of 128 blocks, centered at each player. \n Mob caps are directly proportional to the total number of chunks eligible for spawning. To calculate the cap, the spawning area is expanded by one chunk in every direction, so that it is 17x17 chunks in size, and then the total number of chunks is plugged into the following formula: \n \n cap = constant * chunks / 256\n \n Each mob category has a separate cap and a different constant in the formula: \n \n Hostile = 70\n Passive = 10\n Ambient (Bats) = 15\n Water = 5\n \n In single player mode, the chunk count is 17x17 = 289, and the caps work out to: \n \n Hostile = 79\n Passive = 11\n Ambient = 16\n Water = 5\n \n In multiplayer, chunks that are in range of multiple players are only counted once. So the more spread out the players are, the more chunks will be covered and the higher the caps will be. \n The cap is checked once at the beginning of each spawning cycle. If the number of living mobs in a category is over its cap, the entire spawning cycle for that category is skipped. \n \n \n \n  \nExample of a mob pack spawning. The 41x1x41 spawning area is shaded blue (not to scale). The yellow figures represent the actual positions that mobs could spawn in after checking the environment. Note that the mobs can spawn inside torch and ladder blocks. But they can\'t spawn on top of glass because it\'s not opaque. The red cube is the center of the pack, which must be an air block, but the blocks above and below it can be anything. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nRequirements for the spawning location of individual mobs \n \n \n For each spawning cycle, one attempt is made to spawn a pack of mobs in each eligible chunk. A random location in the chunk is chosen to be the center point of the pack. For the pack to spawn at all, the center block must be water for water mobs and air for all other mobs. Note that in the latter case, it must actually be an air block. Any other block, even a non-colliding one, will prevent the entire pack from spawning . \n If the pack location is suitable, 12 attempts are made to spawn up to 4 mobs (8 for Wolves , 1 for Ghasts ) within a 41x1x41 area centered at that block (that\'s a 41x41 square that is one block high). Mobs will spawn with the lowest part of their body inside this area. For each spawn attempt, a block location within the pack area is chosen at random. Though the pack area extends 21 blocks out from the center, the random location is heavily skewed toward the center of the pack. Approximately 85% of spawns will be within 5 blocks of the pack center, and 99% within 10 blocks of the center. \n All mobs within a pack are the same species. The species for the entire pack is chosen randomly from those eligible to spawn at the location of the first spawn attempt in the pack: \n \n In the Overworld , this depends on the biome :\n \n Most biomes can spawn sheep , pigs , chickens , cows , spiders , zombies , skeletons , creepers , Endermen , Slimes (only in certain chunks if not in a swamp), and Squid . \n Forest and taiga biomes can also spawn Wolves . \n Jungle biomes can also spawn Ocelots . \n Desert, beach, river, and ocean biomes cannot spawn animals; only hostile mobs and Squid . \n Mushroom biomes can spawn only Mooshrooms . \n \n \n There are actually two ways for a Slime to naturally spawn without a Monster Spawner : In any eligible chunk under layer 40, or in a swamp biome at a low light level. \n Cave spiders spawn only from their specific Mob Spawners , which are found in Abandoned Mine Shafts among many cobwebs . \n Silverfish spawn from special stone, cobblestone, and stone brick blocks found in strongholds and extreme hills biomes. They also spawn from specific spawners found in strongholds. \n Blazes spawn from their specific spawners in Nether Fortresses and can also spawn elsewhere in the structures. \n Wither Skeletons and Skeletons can spawn in Nether Fortresses . \n The Nether itself can spawn only Ghasts , Zombie Pigmen , and Magma Cubes . \n The End can spawn only Endermen . \n The Ender Dragon spawns naturally in The End; but only one, ever; and not as part of the general mob spawning process. \n Snow Golems , Iron Golems , and Withers only spawn when built with the exception of Iron Golems spawning in villages with 10 villagers and enough houses. \n \n Each individual spawn attempt succeeds only if all of the following conditions are met: \n \n There must be no players and no player spawn points within a 24 block distance (spherical) of the spawning block \n \n \n If it\'s a squid , then...\n \n the spawning block must contain liquid ( water or lava ) \n the spawning block must be between level 45 and 62, inclusive \n the spawning mob must not be obstructed by other mobs \n \n \n \n \n If it\'s not a squid, then...\n \n the spawning block itself must be non- opaque and non- liquid \n the block directly below it must be opaque or upside down slabs / stairs and may not be bedrock \n the block directly above it must be non-opaque \n the spawning mob must not be obstructed by solid blocks, other mobs or liquids \n \n \n \n \n If it\'s an animal, then...\n \n the block directly below the spawning block must be grass \n the light level of the spawning block must be 9 or brighter \n \n \n \n \n if it\'s an ocelot , then...\n \n the spawning block must be above level 62 \n the block directly below the spawning block must be grass or leaves \n there is a 1/3 chance the spawn will fail \n \n \n \n \n If it\'s a hostile mob in the overworld, then...\n \n the light level of the spawning block must be 7 or darker, and more light increases the chance that the spawn will fail \n sunlight falling on the spawning block further increases the chance that the spawn will fail, by up to 50% \n \n \n \n \n If it\'s a Slime , then...\n \n the spawning block must be in a chunk eligible to spawn slimes (see the Slime page for details) \n the spawning block must be below level 40 \n if the spawn is in a swamp biome, the light level just has to be low \n there is an additional 90% chance the spawn will fail, thus slimes only spawn 1/10th as often as other mobs, all other things being equal \n \n \n \n \n If it\'s a Ghast , then there is a 95% chance the spawn will fail, thus ghasts only spawn 1/20th as often as other mobs \n \n If all of these conditions are met then the mob is spawned. The pack is complete when 4 mobs have spawned (or 8 wolves, or 1 ghast), or 12 attempts have been made, whichever comes first. The exception(s) to these rules is the Enderdragon \n [ edit ] Notes \n \n Due to the general block checks, all mobs besides squid must spawn on top of an opaque block with at least two blocks of headroom, even ghasts, etc. However, short mobs can spawn in a one block high space if the block above is transparent, like a glass block or piston . \n While individual mobs can spawn inside signs, pressure plates, and other non-opaque blocks, packs cannot . They need a completely empty block in the center. Since a pack spawns all at one level, there needs to be some air blocks right above a flat surface to allow mobs to spawn on it, and more air blocks will always allow more spawning. \n Similarly, buildings surrounded by air will spawn more mobs inside than underground rooms because packs that spawn outside of the building can spawn mobs inside it. \n The mob caps tend to be reached in seconds. Because of this, mobs can be funneled into a spawning room by preventing them from spawning outside of it. \n The caps also mean that the faster mobs are killed, the faster they will spawn. \n Because the caps are only checked at the beginning of a spawn cycle, they can be dramatically exceeded when a large number of mobs spawn in a single cycle. This happens often with squid , which have a fairly low cap (5 in single player) but can spawn in the hundreds in a single cycle, in an area with lots of water . \n In multiplayer, mob caps are shared by all players, no matter where they are. If one player can make a lot of mobs spawn near them, say, with a mob farm , players elsewhere in the world will see fewer mobs of the same category. Likewise, if a player can prevent mobs from spawning near them, perhaps by hanging around a large body of water and illuminating nearby caves, they will effectively dump their mobs on everyone else. \n Mobs used to not spawn above y co-ordinate 240 due to a bug, but as of 1.4.6 this is fixed and mobs now can spawn above level 240. \n In multiplayer, if the server.properties file has "view-distance=9" or below, mob spawning is severely reduced (or they de-spawn too quickly), and may result in the player encountering no mobs at all. Set the view distance to 10 or higher to ensure mobs spawn correctly. \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Classic \n \n \n \n The spawning area used to be 17x17 chunks rather than 15x15. The area was reduced, but the old size is still used to calculate mob caps. \n \n \n It was not always possible to funnel mobs into a spawning room by preventing them from spawning elsewhere. Some older sources of information about spawning might make reference to this. \n \n \n Large amounts of empty space used to encourage spawning in the general area. This remains true on a smaller scale, and only horizontally, due to pack spawning. \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 0.2.0 \n The chunk 0,0 (X 0-16 and Z 0-16) is no longer always the first chunk evaluated for mob spawning. If one built a dark room inside that chunk, all mobs would spawn inside that room and nowhere else. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.8 \n The spawn location is no longer always on sand or gravel, even if it wasn\'t on a beach. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0.0 \n Previously, spawn was determined by light level rather than the current chunk properties. This was no longer the case in 1.0.0. In a Beta world, hostile mobs would spawn in light level 7 or lower while friendly mobs would spawn in light levels 9 or higher. Because of this, hostile mobs had a slight chance of spawning even though it was light due to them spawning in the air where there was little light. If you had a lot of torches down, go down to your mine, then return, you would have a tendency to find your house having some cows, pigs, chickens or sheep running about. \n \n \n [ edit ] Issues \n Issues relating to "Spawn" are maintained on Mojira. Report issues there. \n [ edit ] Other types of spawning \n A Monster Spawner causes mobs to spawn constantly in the area around it. \n A thrown chicken egg has a 1 in 8 chance of spawning a chicken , and an additional 1 in 32 chance of spawning 4 chickens from a single egg, so there is a total of 1 in 256 chance for a single thrown egg to spawn 4 chickens. \n Cows, chickens, pigs, sheep, mooshrooms, villagers, ocelots and wolves can breed. All of this requires a player to breed them except for villagers. \n Two snow blocks in the overworld placed on top of each other, with a pumpkin or Jack \'o\' Lantern , causes a Snow Golem to spawn. Likewise, replacing the Snow Blocks with iron blocks (with an extra one on opposite sides of the higher block) will cause an Iron Golem to spawn. Iron Golems can also spawn in villages (though the algorithm that causes this has not yet been determined). Withers can also be spawned by placing blocks. \n In Creative, the player can use Spawn Eggs to spawn most mobs. \n Siege : Zombies can spawn in villages. This is not natural spawning, as it can happen in mushroom biomes or if /gamerule doMobSpawning false is set. \n A Monster Egg will spawn a silverfish if broken, or if a nearby silverfish is attacked. \n A single Ender Dragon spawns in The End . \n Killing medium and large slimes and magma cubes will spawn more of them, but in a smaller size. \n Zombie Pigmen can spawn from nether portals. \n When a pig gets struck by lightning , it turns into a zombie pigman . \n [ edit ] Despawning \n \n \n \n  \nVarious mob spawning ranges, illustrated \n \n \n Monsters (not holding items or wearing armor) and squid (but not animals), including hostile wolves as of 1.1, can cease to exist, or "despawn", under certain conditions: \n \n A mob will immediately despawn if ever there is no player within 128 blocks of it. Note that this appears to be a sphere, not a cylinder from map top to bottom. \n A mob that has had no player within 32 blocks of it for more than 30 seconds has a 1 in 800 chance of despawning on each game tick (1/20th of a second). Therefore, the half-life of monsters not within 32 blocks of a player is 27.73 seconds, after the initial 30 seconds have elapsed. \n All hostile mobs (including those that are holding items) in a world will despawn if the difficulty is set to peaceful, regardless as to where the player is positioned in the world. \n \n In multiplayer, despawning does not occur while there are no players in the game. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Sometimes it is possible for the world spawn to be underground or in the ocean. \n World spawns can even be inside a dungeon.

(Torch added by player to prevent mob spawning.) \n \n \n Dungeons are naturally generated structures that appear in the Overworld . \n They are small rooms made of Cobblestone and Moss Stone and contain a hostile Mob Spawner and up to 2 Chests . Finding a dungeon without a chest is very unlikely, but possible. Occasionally, a dungeon will spawn with its chests in such a way as to create a double chest . Dungeons generate with either a zombie , skeleton , or spider spawner that can easily be deactivated by placing torches all around the spawner. \n Anyone exploring a cavern should be wary of encountering a dungeon, as they are almost always connected to large caverns. Also, a dungeon generated near the surface of a desert biome will cause sand to collapse and form a square depression. This can be a good way for inexperienced players to locate a dungeon and the resources associated with them. \n Dungeons do exist on Peaceful mode, as they are generated with the map. Monster Spawners will still spawn mobs in peaceful mode, but the mobs will instantly despawn. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Properties \n \n 1.1 Chest contents \n \n \n 2 Locating a dungeon \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Tips \n 6 Trivia \n 7 Gallery \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Properties \n A perfectly generated Dungeon, one which has not been overwritten by other generated terrain, will: \n \n Be 5x5, 5x7 or 7x7 of floor space in size \n Have cobblestone walls, and a mix of cobblestone and moss stone floor \n Have 0-2 chests \n Have a hostile monster spawner (these can be easily utilized by the player for mob farming) \n \n It is very likely for a dungeon to be overwritten by other generated terrain, thus distorting the dungeon. It is also possible, but rare, to find two dungeons joined together, with 2 spawners and 0-4 chests - although sometimes (even more rarely) triple dungeons can be found with 0-6 chests and 3 spawners. \n The mob spawner acts as a guard for the loot, spawning an indefinite number of mobs until the player can light up the room sufficiently to stop new mobs from being spawned, or simply break the spawner itself. This is usually accomplished by placing a torch on and around the spawner. The mob spawner is always in the center of the dungeon room, with chests located around the walls of the room (large chests can connect with the short side against the wall). The chests contain randomly generated treasure that are placed in random slots. \n A spawner in a dungeon has 50% chance of being a Zombie spawner, 25% chance of producing Skeletons , and 25% chance of producing Spiders . \n It is usually fairly easy to convert a dungeon to a "minifarm" for experience and drops, but the details will vary with the dungeon\'s location and environment. However, the spawner will not activate unless the player is standing within 15 blocks of it.(See Mob Spawner ) \n [ edit ] Chest contents \n Each dungeon chest block contains up to 8 item stacks, with the following distribution: \n \n \n Item stack \n Chance \nto spawn \n Chance of at least \none stack in a chest \n Number \nin one stack \n \n \n Saddle \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n Iron Ingot \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1-4 \n \n \n Bread \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n Wheat \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1-4 \n \n \n Gunpowder \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1-4 \n \n \n String \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1-4 \n \n \n Bucket \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n Enchanted Book \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 120 \n 6.5% \n 1 \n \n \n Redstone \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1-4 \n \n \n 13 disc \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n cat disc \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n Golden Apple (Normal) \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 120 \n 6.5% \n 1 \n \n \n Name Tag \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 12 \n 50.1% \n 1 \n \n \n Iron Horse Armor \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 24 \n 28.9% \n 1 \n \n \n Gold Horse Armor \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 60 \n 12.6% \n 1 \n \n \n Diamond Horse Armor \n 1 \xe2\x81\x84 120 \n 6.5% \n 1 \n \n \n This information was obtained from Minecraft\'s code. The generation algorithm places one of these items in a random slot in the chest eight times, possibly overwriting items already placed. \n [ edit ] Locating a dungeon \n Dungeons can generate almost anywhere underground, but they are most common around Layer 26, and frequent between Layers 16 and 42. \n A reliable way of locating dungeons is through listening, either for a large amount of noise from one kind of mob, or for ambience . Neither of these things are an exclusive trait of a dungeon, but they do mean that there is an unlit and unexplored area nearby, which may well be a dungeon, particularly in the case of frequent, similar mob noises. \n Another good way of locating a dungeon is searching for moss stone inside of a cave, abandoned mine shafts , etc. this may be the fastest way to locate a dungeon. Another way is to look for newly placed cobblestone. \n Another way to find a dungeon is to look for fallen sand or gravel in a square pattern. \n Very rarely, dungeons will spawn in the side of a mountain making them easy to spot but hard to safely reach. \n Finally, pushing glowstone (or TNT) into the same block as the player\'s head using a piston will allow them to see through walls. If the player spots a cuboid area underground using this method, chances are it\'s a dungeon! \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Infdev \n \n \n Seecret Friday Update 2 \n Added dungeons. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.4 \n Added cocoa beans to dungeons. \n \n \n 1.7 \n Dungeons look different due to the cobblestone texture change. \n \n \n 1.8 \n Bread can appear in groups of 2, because food became stackable in 1.8 \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.3 \n 12w22a \n Breaking the spawner of a dungeon gives experience. \n \n \n 1.4.6 \n 12w49a \n Added enchanted books to dungeons. \n \n \n 1.6 \n 13w16b \n Added name tags and horse armor to dungeons. \n \n \n [ edit ] Tips \n \n To defeat a dungeon, aside from the obvious method of fighting the monsters and lighting up the area, one can instead tunnel underneath it and destroy the spawner from below. \n It is also possible to dig a tunnel above the dungeon and flood the area with lava, kill all of the mobs, then place torches to disable the spawner just as the last of the lava disappears. You can fill the entire dungeon with sand and/ or gravel. When the blocks that gravity applies to fall on top of the mobs, they will be crushed and killed. Once the room is filled, you can dig out the chest and loot it. You can also set a block of TNT above the spawner and prime the TNT, but doing so will destroy the spawner, and the dungeon cannot be used as mob grinder. \n Digging around the sides of the dungeon will allow you to bypass the spawner and loot the chests directly without any risk of health loss. \n A fast way to collect loot from the chest is to destroy the chest rather than removing the items from it. This way you collect all loot as well as the chest. \n Torches can be placed directly on the monster spawner. Placing one on each side provides the same effect as placing a torch on the blocks adjacent to the spawner, without needing to be replaced when you mine the floor out for Moss Stone. \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n \n \n  \nA caved in surface dungeon. \n \n \n \n The spawner will drop 13-40 EXP when broken by the player \n Dungeons will still generate if the \'generate structures\' option is toggled to off, even though they are claimed not to by the in-game description. \n Dungeons are almost always connected to a cavern, and because the cavern can be as small as a single block of air, the dungeon could completely overwrite it, usually resulting in a dungeon with no entrance. \n Rarely, a mushroom will appear in a dungeon on mossy cobblestone. \n It is possible, though almost impossibly rare for a dungeon to be generated at bedrock level, thereby deleting the bedrock. In which case digging through the moss stone can lead into the Void . \n Rarely, on peaceful, a monster spawner may spawn a monster that plays its sound file before it can despawn. \n If a dungeon has fallen gravel or sand in it, then placing a torch on the spawner may not be sufficient to light up the entire area to prevent spawning. \n It is rarely possible for a player to find a dungeon with two spawners and up to 4 chests. This only occurs when a 5x5 dungeon spawns within a 7x7 dungeon, since the dungeon will remove any blocks from the walls or floor that open into a cave, the walls of the smaller dungeon will be removed, resulting in a 7x7 floor space with one spawner in the middle, and a second spawner adjacent or diagonally adjacent to the first. \n Double-chest dungeons as shown below may have chests that form a perpendicular barrier between the wall and spawner (an exception to this would be in 7x7 dungeons, in which the chest cannot reach the spawner): \n \n \n \n \xe2\x80\x83 \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Each block of the floor (including under the walls) has a 25% chance of being cobblestone, and a 75% chance of being moss stone. \n If a dungeon loads in two chunks and one regenerates (often causing a flat vertical wall), the dungeon can become partially generated. This can be found if one of the walls of the dungeon is not cobblestone, but rather stone. Sometimes, the partially generated dungeon will not have a spawner or a chest. Example of a partially generated dungeon \n The contents of chests in dungeons appear to be based on the world seed. \n If you are playing on peaceful in a skeleton dungeon, sometimes skeletons will shoot arrows before despawning. \n Many players consider skeleton dungeons as the hardest to conquer. However, an easy tactic to use is to let many (5-6 are recommended) skeletons to spawn. Then, simply run inside of the dungeon. Most of the skeletons will be in such a frenzy to hurt you that they will shoot each other, and eventually kill themselves. While they are doing this, spam torches on the walls, preventing further spawning. If you want, you can kill some of the skeletons on your own after you are finished with the torches. Armor (preferably iron at least) and a stone , iron , or diamond sword are recommended. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A double-chest generated in dungeon. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dungeons\' roofs are that of the cave, so it is possible for a gravel vein above the dungeon to fall into it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Five dungeons and 2 cave spider spawners close together in a mineshaft, cleared to show all 7 spawners (pre 1.4) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon found under a frozen ocean \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A double dungeon, the wall of the first acting as the entrance of the second. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dungeons can rarely be found open to the surface. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A double dungeon with three chests. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon exposed by a ravine. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon intersecting with an abandoned mineshaft. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon found by an End Portal room in a stronghold. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon in multiplayer (notice the monster spawner has a pig inside). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon found in the water. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon, stronghold and an Abandoned Mine Shaft in one area. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon located within a Bedrock Layer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon open to the surface. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A floating dungeon in a cave system. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A dungeon distorted by a cave system. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The cave dungeon spawns in can be even this small. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dungeon spawned aside the chest chamber of the temple.

In multiplayer , all present players in the Overworld must be in a bed for the world to skip to dawn. \n If a player\'s bed is destroyed and the player dies, a message is displayed saying "your home bed was missing or obstructed", and the player will respawn at the original spawn point. Keeping this in mind, the player should keep their "base" near the original spawn or know how to navigate to that base from the original spawn. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Crafting \n 2 Placement \n 3 Sleep interruption \n 4 Behavior \n \n 4.1 Multiplayer \n \n \n 5 Video \n 6 History \n 7 Issues \n 8 Trivia \n 9 Gallery \n 10 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Crafting \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Wool + Wood Planks \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n   \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Note: Neither the color of the wool nor the type of wood used has any effect on the bed\'s appearance. The only way to change the colors is with a texture pack or a mod \n [ edit ] Placement \n Beds, unlike typical blocks, take up two blocks of space. Placement requires at least this much space away from the player\'s facing direction. When placed, the foot will be placed on the block selected and will face toward the user. Two or more beds can be placed next to each other, effectively allowing double beds. Like certain other blocks, beds can not be placed on snow, ice, glowstone, glass, or (as of version 1.0) leaves. If you remove the blocks underneath the bed, the bed will not be removed, but will remain floating. The floating bed method allows beds to be placed over each other and on blocks you can\'t normally place them on. \n Beds are 9/16 of a block high, one more pixel than half a block. This prevents you from walking onto the bed from one level below the bed without jumping, but allows you to walk up onto other blocks while on top of the bed. \n Obstruction occurs unless there\'s a solid block (the same restrictions apply as the bed itself) at \'floor level\' with 2 air blocks above it in one of the ten blocks that surround the bed. It doesn\'t matter if the bed itself has blocks above it. In other words: in order to work the player must be able to stand next to the bed at the same level as it, on a type of block that a bed could be placed on. \n [ edit ] Sleep interruption \n In old versions of Minecraft, sleeping in a "vulnerable" bed would cause the player to wake up early with a skeleton or zombie spawned next to them (referred to as a "nightmare"). A bed was considered vulnerable if it was placed in an area that passing monsters could access, with a generous definition\xe2\x80\x94merely placing beds next to external walls would also cause this. \n In recent and current versions of Minecraft, nightmares are gone, but you cannot sleep if a hostile mob is within 8 blocks of the bed horizontally (along each axis) and 5 blocks vertically. If a monster is nearby, even through a wall, the message "You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby" will be displayed and the player will not be able to sleep until the monsters go away or are killed. \n [ edit ] Behavior \n Beds are used by pressing the use item button looking at the bed during the night. They can also be used during thunderstorms but not during rain or snow. Attempting to use a bed at any other time will result in a "You can only sleep at night" message. \n If all sleeping requirements are met and the player enters a bed, the player will be positioned in the bed and the screen will slowly fade to black. During this time, the player can leave the bed by clicking the "Leave Bed" button. Once the player has entered the bed, the spawn point is set near the bed. \n \n \n The falling-asleep animation. \n \n \n Sleeping only changes the time of day to sunrise; it does not speed up processes which take place over time such as the decay of dropped items, plant growth, and smelting . However, if it were raining or snowing, the weather is likely to end overnight. If the player went to bed late in the night (after monsters have spawned), they will be able to collect the drops from sunburnt undead, and easily kill off a few stragglers. Of course, there may also be creepers about, but those despawn faster than the items do. \n Beds placed in the Nether or the End will explode when the player tries to sleep, and set fire to surrounding blocks. [1] [2] The bed will drop as an item , and may be picked up and placed again. Some have suggested that this could be used for mining in the Nether, but this would be excessively hazardous: Given the point-blank range, the explosion may well kill even an armored player. \n [ edit ] Multiplayer \n \n To skip the night, all survival-mode players in the Overworld must be in bed at the same time. However, players in The Nether or The End don\'t have to sleep for this to happen (there is no day/night cycle in either of these dimensions), nor do players in creative mode. \n Players can also chat while in bed, and can leave the bed before the time-skip (thus blocking it for everyone). \n Destroying a bed while another player is sleeping would cause the player to wake up, even when it was not caused by a player who broke it (when an explosion destroys it). \n If you try to sleep in a bed occupied by another player, you will get the message "This bed is occupied". \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.3 \n Added beds. Sleeping in an area potentially exposed to monsters could cause players to wake up early, with a skeleton or zombie spawned next to them. Early plans for changing the spawn was Crying Obsidian . \n \n \n 1.4 \n Sleeping in a bed now resets your spawn position, though does not work for most users. Apparently, at the moment the spawn point unintentionally only changes if "Leave bed" is clicked and the function is limited to SMP. \n \n \n 1.4_01 \n Beds now act as a respawn point as intended. \n \n \n 1.6 \n Trying to sleep in the Nether causes the bed to explode. \n \n \n 1.7 \n The bed side texture has been moved in the texture pack file, as well as the cake texture. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0.0 \n Beds no longer spawn monsters; instead players can no longer sleep if monsters are nearby. \n \n \n 1.2.5 \n Cats in standing position will now purposely go and sit on nearby chests, active furnaces, and beds, preventing players from using them. \n \n \n 1.5 \n Beds check their biome for detonation rather than just their dimension. \n \n \n Pocket Edition Alpha \n \n \n 0.4.0 \n Added beds. \n \n \n [ edit ] Issues \n Issues relating to "Bed" are maintained on Mojira. Report issues there. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n When walked on, beds make the sound of stone. \n Although they are taller than slabs, they can be walked off when sneaking. \n Beds cannot be destroyed by fire . \n If the player falls from high enough to take damage, but right click on a bed before they hit the ground, they won\'t take fall damage.\n \n This also happens with minecarts and boats . \n \n \n If there is a solid block above a bed, the surface of the bed will become black, much as with slabs . \n Beds have the widest varieties of different blocks that can be use to craft them. Any type of wool or wooden plank can be used to craft it. \n If the language is set to Canadian English and the player tries to sleep during the day, you get a message that says "Sorry, you can only sleep at night." On every other English setting, it will simply say "You can only sleep at night". This is a joke on stereotypical Canadian politeness and constant apologizing. \n The /give command can be used to get the foot of the bed. The command is /give &lt; player &gt; 26 1 . If you place a pressure plate next to this foot of the bed, and step on the pressure plate, the block will break but you will get a full bed back. Also, if you place two of these blocks together, they will act like a full bed, but appear like the bed has two feet. \n You can put water on top of a bed and sleep as if you\'re floating or swimming. \n The bed\'s explosion in the End and Nether is more powerful than that of TNT. \n If the world is quit while sleeping, on returning the player shall be awake beside the bed. \n The player avatar clips just slightly into the bed if they have something in their hand and their feet protrude off the edge. \n Using the /tp command while another player is sleeping will still teleport the sleeping player. \n If you place a half bed on ice, the bed acts like the ice. \n You cannot place a bed on top of glass , even if you place it on a valid block (with the head rest side to be above glass). \n Beds aren\'t destroyable in adventure mode. \n Beds will blow up in any dimension except the overworld even in mods by default. \n When sleeping in the presence of villagers , the villagers will look at the spot where the player\'s head would be if they were standing on the bed. \n If a player sleeps when a Jukebox is playing, the sound\'s direction will not adjust to the player\'s change in orientation until they wake up. \n In minecraft pocket edition, it is possible to sleep in a bed to restore heath, even before 0.7.1. \n In Xbox 360 edition, there is a glitch where you can push a player off a bed, and the player will still be sleeping, unaware of what happened.\n \n There is also a glitch where you can move your head up and down. Other players can see this, but in 1st-person view, it\'s still. \n \n \n If you sleep when the DayLightCycle is turned off,you will fall asleep,but wake up at night. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A player during sleep \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Sleeping Player in SMP.

For drops as in falls, see Fall Damage \n \n \n \n  \nTypical drops from a Skeleton : Experience Orbs , an Arrow , and Bones . \n \n \n Drops are items which appear when mobs and some other entities die. There are three basic types of drops: normal drops, rare drops, and Experience Orbs . Only normal drops appear when a mob is killed other than by the player. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Common and uncommon drops \n 2 Rare drops \n 3 Experience Orbs \n 4 Mob drops \n 5 Entity drops \n 6 Block drops \n 7 History \n 8 Trivia \n 9 See also \n 10 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Common and uncommon drops \n Common drops may occur whenever a mob dies, and appear at the location of the mob at the moment it receives the killing damage. Most mobs have particular items which it may drop when killed. There are also "uncommon drops", such as spider eyes , which don\'t always drop, but have a large (item-specific) chance to do so. Some uncommon and common drops don\'t drop at all if the mob was not "killed by the player" (same rules as for experience orbs). \n For each of these items, there is a random ( uniform ) distribution of numbers of that item it will drop; for example, a cow will drop 0-2 leather items and 1-3 raw beef items. Since the range includes 0, it is possible for no leather to be dropped. If the mob is killed with a weapon with the Looting enchantment , then the upper limit of the range is increased by the level number of the enchantment. \n If a mob is a baby animal , it will not drop anything when killed. \n \n Note: The term "common drops" was chosen by the authors of this article. It is not known to be an official term. \n \n [ edit ] Rare drops \n \n \n \n  \nA bow received from a rare drop with Power I \n \n \n Rare drops occur in addition to the common drops. Unlike most common drops, they only occur if the monster is killed by a player. All rare drops except skulls can also be obtained by other means. Rare drops are always a single item, not multiples. \n Rare drops have a 2.5% chance of occurring when a monster dies. Using a weapon with the Looting enchantment increases the chance by 0.5% per level (up to 4% with Looting III). \n Each monster has a separate list of possibilities for enchanted rare drops and non-enchanted rare drops. Within each list, all items are equally likely. \n Additionally to rare drops, a monster can drop equipment and armor that it\'s visibly wearing. Each piece of equipment that monster was spawned with is dropped with 8.5% chance. Looting increases this change by 1% per level (up to 11.5% with Looting III). This means it is possible for a zombie or skeleton to drop more than one piece of equipment upon death. All items that mob picked up after spawning are always dropped, even when the monster wasn\'t killed by a player. \n When items are enchanted, the enchantment is chosen in the same way as using an Enchantment Table with a cost of 5\xe2\x80\x9315 levels on normal difficulty, and 5\xe2\x80\x9335 on hard. On easy difficulty, equipment is never enchanted. It is possible to get multiple enchantments. \n [ edit ] Experience Orbs \n \n Main article: Experience Orb \n \n Experience Orbs only drop if a mob dies less than three seconds after being attacked (melee, bow, snowballs, eggs) by a player or by a player\'s pet wolf . Their total value will always be the specific amount of experience granted by killing that mob. They are also dropped from a thrown Bottle o\' Enchanting . Collected experience accumulates into levels, which can be used for enchanting . \n Experience Orbs are similar to items but not the same. Unlike other drops, Experience Orbs appear at the location of the mob\'s corpse at the moment it disappears in a puff of smoke. Experience Orbs will move towards nearby players. \n [ edit ] Mob drops \n \n \n Mob \n Exp \n Common drops \n Rare drops \n Equipped and worn items \n Notes \n \n \n Animals \n \n \n   Bat \n 0 \n None \n None \n None \n \n \n \n   Chicken \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n 0\xe2\x80\x932   Feather \n1   Raw Chicken or 1   Cooked Chicken \n None \n None \n Meat is cooked if died while on fire. \nMeat unaffected by looting. \nAlso drops   Egg every 5\xe2\x80\x9310 minutes. \n \n \n   Cow \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n 0\xe2\x80\x932   Leather \n1\xe2\x80\x933   Raw Beef or 1\xe2\x80\x933   Steak \n None \n None \n Meat is cooked if died while on fire. \nGives   Milk when right-clicked with an empty bucket. \n \n \n   Donkey \n   Mule \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n 0\xe2\x80\x932   Leather \n None \n 1   Saddle if saddled \n1   Chest if equipped \n Also drops all of the chest\'s contents. \n \n \n   Horse \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n 0\xe2\x80\x932   Leather \n None \n 1   Saddle if saddled \n1   Horse Armor if equipped \n \n \n \n   Mooshroom \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n 0\xe2\x80\x932   Leather \n1\xe2\x80\x933   Raw Beef or 1\xe2\x80\x933   Steak \n None \n None \n Meat is cooked if died while on fire. \nShearing drops 5   Red Mushroom , converting it to a normal cow, a process which cannot be reverted. \nGives   Milk when right-clicked with an empty bucket. \nGives   Mushroom Stew when right-clicked with an empty bowl. \n \n \n   Ocelot \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n None \n None \n None \n \n \n \n   Pig \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n 1\xe2\x80\x933   Raw Porkchop or 1\xe2\x80\x933   Cooked Porkchop \n None \n 1   Saddle if saddled \n Meat is cooked if died while on fire. \n \n \n   Sheep \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n 1   Wool if not sheared \n None \n None \n Not affected by Looting. \nShearing drops 1-3   Wool . \nWool is colored if the sheep was spawned colored or dyed. \n \n \n   Skeleton Horse \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n 0\xe2\x80\x932   Bone \n None \n None \n \n \n \n   Squid \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n 1\xe2\x80\x933   Ink Sac \n None \n None \n \n \n \n   Wolf \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n None \n None \n None \n \n \n \n   Zombie Horse \n 1\xe2\x80\x933 \n 0\xe2\x80\x932   Rotten Flesh \n None \n None \n Rotten Flesh is an uncommon drop. \n \n \n Golems \n \n \n   Iron Golem \n 0 \n 0\xe2\x80\x932   Rose \n3\xe2\x80\x935   Iron Ingot \n None \n None \n Not affected by Looting. \n \n \n   Snow Golem \n 0 \n 0\xe2\x80\x9315   Snowball or \n1   Pumpkin + 8   Snowball if spawned with at least 8 in the world . \n None \n None \n Not affected by Looting. \n Pumpkin and 8 Snowballs due to 8 existing snow golems is only in Xbox 360 Edition . \n \n \n Monsters \n \n \n   Blaze \n 10 \n 0\xe2\x80\x931   Blaze Rod if killed by a player or tamed dog \n0\xe2\x80\x932   Glowstone Dust if killed by a player \n None \n None \n Glowstone Dust can only be dropped by Blazes in the Xbox 360 Edition . \n \n \n   Cave Spider \n 5 \n 0\xe2\x80\x932   String \n0\xe2\x80\x931   Spider Eye if killed by a player or tamed dog \n None \n None \n Eye is an uncommon drop (33% chance). \nLooting doesn\'t affect number of eyes dropped, but increases probability of a drop. \n \n \n   Creeper \n 5 \n 0\xe2\x80\x932   Gunpowder \n1   Music Disc if killed by a skeleton \n None \n None \n \n \n \n   Ender Dragon \n 12,000 \n None \n None \n None \n Experience is dropped in 10 drops of 1000 experience and one drop of 2000 experience. \nCreates a portal including removable blocks: \n4   Torch \n1   Dragon Egg \n \n \n   Enderman \n 5 \n 0\xe2\x80\x931   Ender Pearl \n None \n None \n \n \n \n   Ghast \n 5 \n 0\xe2\x80\x931   Ghast Tear \n0\xe2\x80\x932   Gunpowder \n None \n None \n \n \n \n   Magma Cube \n 1, 2, or 4 \n 0\xe2\x80\x931   Magma Cream if size &gt;

Multiplication happen with the following chances:\n \n Fortune I: 33% * 2 (33% more on average) \n Fortune II: 25% * 2, 25% * 3 (75% more on average) \n Fortune III: 20% * 2, 20% * 3, 20% * 4 (120% more on average) \n \n \n Container blocks ( brewing stand , chest , dispenser , dropper , flower pot , furnace , hopper , and jukebox ) drop themselves when broken along with their content. \n All blocks not listed in the table above drop themselves when broken.

Before that, it was just 13 and cat. \n \n \n 1.1 \n Magma Cubes can now drop Magma Cream on death. \n \n \n 1.2.1 \n 12w06a \n Zombies have a rare chance to drop an iron ingot , iron helmet , iron shovel , or iron sword . \n \n \n Skeletons have a rare chance to drop a bow or an enchanted bow . \n \n \n Zombie Pigmen have a rare chance to drop a golden helmet , gold ingot , golden sword , or an enchanted golden sword . \n \n \n 12w08a \n Iron Golems were added, which dropped iron ingots and roses . \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w25a \n Pigs now drop 1-3 porkchops instead of 0-2. \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w32a \n New command - /gamerule doMobLoot (true/false) toggles whether or not mobs drop loot. \n \n \n Zombies, skeletons, and zombie pigmen can sometimes wear armor, which has a rare chance of being dropped. \n \n \n 12w34a \n Zombies have a chance to drop carrots and potatoes . \n \n \n 12w36a \n Wither drops a Nether Star on death. \n \n \n Wither Skeleton added. Drops bones , coal and rarely stone swords and Wither Skeleton Skulls when killed by players. \n \n \n Saddled pigs will now always drop saddles on death. \n \n \n 12w38a \n Witch added. Rarely drops potions of instant health and fire resistance. \n \n \n 12w38b \n Witch can now drop potion ingredients, sticks and have a chance of dropping what they\'re holding at the time of death. \n \n \n 1.4.3pre \n The Disc "11" is now dropped by Creepers in the same way as the other Discs. \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Dropped weapons, tools, and armor from mobs will have at least 25 durability remaining, which is also the most common. Less-damaged items are increasingly rare. Except for gold swords and tools, items will always have at least 26 points of damage taken. \n Due to Zombies and Skeletons rarely spawning with random armor, and having a 5% chance of dropping one article of said worn armor on death, it is finally possible to legitimately acquire chainmail armor without trading with villagers. \n While skeletons will drop bows of differing enchantments, the most common seems to be "Power I."

From left to right: no armor, leather , gold , chain, iron , and diamond . \n \n \n Armor is a category of items that provide a player with varying levels of protection from common damage types, and appear graphically on the wearer. These items include several different classes of helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots, which can each be placed in designated armor slots of a player\'s inventory for activation. Players , Horses , Zombie ( Pigmen ) and ( Wither ) Skeletons can wear armor. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Classes \n \n 1.1 Novelty armor \n \n \n 2 Mechanics \n 3 Damage types \n 4 Defense statistics \n \n 4.1 Defense points \n 4.2 Durability \n 4.3 Enchantments \n \n \n 5 Crafting \n 6 Data values \n 7 History \n \n 7.1 Mob armor \n \n 7.1.1 Mob "armor" \n \n \n 7.2 Leather-chain armor \n \n \n 8 Video \n 9 Trivia \n \n 9.1 Leather \n 9.2 Chain \n 9.3 Pocket Edition \n \n \n 10 Gallery \n 11 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Classes \n \n \n \n  \nThe armor section in the Pocket Edition inventory (introduced in 0.6.0) \n \n \n Armor classes include (from weakest/least durable to strongest/most durable): \n \n Leather \n Gold \n Chain \n Iron \n Diamond \n \n Chain armor is rare, and uncraftable via legitimate in-game means. It can be obtained through trading with villagers or as rare drops from mobs wearing them. It can be crafted with the fire item, though that item is only available via inventory editors . \n [ edit ] Novelty armor \n A player can wear a pumpkin as a helmet. This will partially block the player\'s view and does not reduce attack damage, but it will prevent an Enderman from becoming aggressive towards the player when the player looks at it. However, putting on the pumpkin after provoking the enderman or attacking the enderman with the pumpkin on will NOT stop it from attacking. \n A player can wear a head as a helmet, changing their appearance. Heads do not reduce damage. \n Leather armor can be dyed to create colored clothing with some protection. \n [ edit ] Mechanics \n Whenever a piece of armor absorbs damage for the player, the armor itself is damaged, reducing its durability . After taking enough damage, the armor piece is destroyed. \n The player\'s current protection level is represented visually by the armor meter, which contains 10 armor icons that each represent 8% damage reduction. With all 10 shown full, the player has a total of 80% damage reduction. The armor meter is affected by the particular pieces currently worn, as well as the class and current durability of each piece. \n When the player takes damage of a sort that is not affected by armor (see damage types below), armor they are wearing does not take damage. \n Armor can also be enchanted to provide protection enhancements, such as protection from additional damage types. These will not affect the armor meter. \n [ edit ] Damage types \n The following types of damage are reduced by armor and, consequently, damage the armor itself: \n \n Direct attacks from mobs and players \n Getting hit with an arrow \n Getting hit with a fireball from a Ghast or Blaze or getting hit by a Fire Charge \n Touching fire , lava or cactus \n Explosions \n \n \nThe following types of damage are not reduced by armor and have no effect on the armor itself: \n \n Ongoing damage from being on fire * \n Suffocating inside a block* \n Drowning in water* \n Starvation \n Falling into the Void * \n Poisoning ; e.g., from a cave spider attack or a Potion of Poison \n Instant damage from a Potion of Harming \n /kill command \n Wither potion effects \n Fall Damage. (including Ender Pearls )* \n Getting struck by lightning. \n \n *Except in Pocket Edition \n \nProtection enchantments can protect from types of damage that armor doesn\'t normally protect against, such as fall damage . Armor durability still doesn\'t decrease when protection-enchanted armor takes environmental damage. \n [ edit ] Defense statistics \n [ edit ] Defense points \n Defense points are each signified by half of a shirt of mail in the armor bar above the health bar. Each defense point will reduce any damage dealt to the player which is absorbed by armor by 4%, increasing additively with the number of defense points. Different materials and combinations of armor provide different levels of defense. A full suit of diamond armor protects the player from 80% of damage, whereas a full suit of iron will provide 60% protection and a full suit of leather will provide 28%. \n The following table shows the amount of defense points added by each individual piece of armor, as well as the total points added by a full set of armor for each material. \n \n \n Material \n Full set \n Helmet \n Chestplate \n Leggings \n Boots \n \n \n Leather \n    \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n Gold \n      \n  \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n Chain \n      \n  \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n Iron \n       \n  \n    \n    \n  \n \n \n Diamond \n         \n   \n    \n    \n   \n \n \n The following table shows the number of defense points (  ) per unit of material. Thus, a pair of iron boots (  ) provides 50% efficiency-4 ingots to 2 points of armor, whereas a diamond chestplate (    ) provides 100% efficiency-8 diamonds to 8 points of armor. \n \n \n Material \n Full Set \n Helmet \n Chestplate \n Leggings \n Boots \n \n \n Leather \n 29.2% \n 20% \n 37.5% \n 28.6% \n 25% \n \n \n Gold \n 45.8% \n 40% \n 62.5% \n 42.9% \n 25% \n \n \n Chain \n 50% \n 40% \n 62.5% \n 57.1% \n 25% \n \n \n Iron \n 62.5% \n 40% \n 75% \n 71.4% \n 50% \n \n \n Diamond \n 83.3% \n 60% \n 100% \n 85.7% \n 75% \n \n \n Thus, a full set of diamond armor gives .833 defense points per diamond, whereas a full set of leather armor gives .292 (65% less) defense points. \n [ edit ] Durability \n The following table shows the amount of damage each piece of armor can absorb before being destroyed. \n Any "hit" from a damage source that can be blocked by armor will remove one point of durability from each piece of armor worn. Damage taken that armor doesn\'t protect (such as falling or drowning ) will not damage the armor, even if it is enchanted to protect against that type of damage. The following chart displays how many hits each piece of armor can endure. \n \n \n Material \n Helmet \n Chestplate \n Leggings \n Boots \n \n \n Leather \n 56 \n 81 \n 76 \n 66 \n \n \n Gold \n 78 \n 113 \n 106 \n 92 \n \n \n Chain / Iron \n 166 \n 241 \n 226 \n 196 \n \n \n Diamond \n 364 \n 529 \n 496 \n 430 \n \n \n The following tables shows the durability per unit of material for each piece of armor, compared to that of the boots. Note that the durability per unit does not depend on the particular material. \n \n \n \n Helmet \n Chestplate \n Leggings \n Boots \n \n \n durability/unit \n 68% \n 61% \n 66% \n 100% \n \n \n This means that for the same number of leather/iron ingots/gold ingots/chain/diamond, boots can take 1.5 more damage than leggings. Thus, chestplate and leggings offer more defense points per unit, but have a less durability per unit. \n [ edit ] Enchantments \n Enchantments can improve armor\'s capability to reduce damage, or add capabilities. \n An armor\'s material determines how enchantable it is. The higher a material\'s enchantability, the greater the chances of getting multiple and high-level enchantments (see enchantment mechanics for details). \n \n \n Leather \n Gold \n Chain \n Iron \n Diamond \n \n \n 15 \n 25 \n 12 \n 9 \n 10 \n \n \n As with several enchantments , several different levels of protection are possible. The maximum level of a protection enchantment is currently IV (4). Protection enchantments from multiple pieces of armor stack together, up to a calculated maximum. \n Each protection enchantment protects against specific types of damage. The amount of damage reduction depends on the Enchantment Protection Factor (EPF) provided by that enchantment. [1] \n \n \n Enchantment \n Damage reduced for \n Type Modifier \n EPF \nLevel I \n EPF \nLevel II \n EPF \nLevel III \n EPF \nLevel IV \n \n \n Protection \n All \n 0.75 \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 5 \n \n \n Fire Protection \n Fire , lava , and blaze fireballs \n 1.25 \n 2 \n 4 \n 6 \n 9 \n \n \n Blast Protection \n Explosions \n 1.5 \n 3 \n 5 \n 7 \n 11 \n \n \n Projectile Protection \n Arrows , ghast and blaze fireballs \n 1.5 \n 3 \n 5 \n 7 \n 11 \n \n \n Feather Falling \n Fall damage (including ender pearls ) \n 2.5 \n 5 \n 8 \n 12 \n 18 \n \n \n The EPFs for each enchantment and level are the result of the following formula: floor ( (6 + level * level) * TypeModifier / 3 ) . \n When a player or mob wearing armor is subjected to damage, the EPFs of all applicable enchantments are added together, capped at 25, multiplied by a random value between 50% and 100%, rounded up, and capped again at 20. The damage is then reduced by 4% per point of total effective EPF (for example, a total effective EPF of 20 reduces damage by 80%). \n Because of the caps in the calculation, it\'s possible to max out protection against specific types of damage with only three pieces of armor. For example, two pieces of armor with Blast Protection IV (EPF 11 each) and a single piece with Protection III (EPF 3) would give a total EPF of 25 versus explosions (before the remainder of the calculation). Any additional EPF would be wasted against explosions (but might be useful against other types of damage, if applicable). \n If the damage is of a type that armor protects against normally, this reduction applies only to the damage that got through the armor. For example, a full suit of diamond armor reduces damage from melee attacks by 80% -- if each piece of armor also had a Protection IV enchantment (EPF 5 each), the enchantments would further reduce damage by 40% to 80% each time, for a total damage reduction of 88% to 96% (i.e., 80%, plus 40%-80% of the remaining 20%). \n [ edit ] Crafting \n It takes 24 units of a given material to make a full set of armor. It is not necessary that all of your armor pieces are the same class, though each individual piece can only consist of one material. You could wear a leather cap with an iron chestplate, for example, but you cannot craft a single chestplate from both iron and leather. \n Chestplates (tunics) provide the most protection per unit of material, followed by leggings (pants). For Iron and Diamond, boots are then followed by helmets, but for other materials, the helmet (cap) is more efficient. However, boots are always the most durable. \n As with other items with durability , armor can be repaired by placing two pieces of the same type (e.g., iron helmets) in a crafting grid. The resulting item will have slightly more durability left than the original items combined, but any enchantments will be lost. Armor can also be repaired on an anvil , which preserves and combines enchantments. Anvils can also repair a piece of armor using units of that armor\'s base material. Chain armor can be repaired in this manner by using iron ingots. \n Duplicate armor pieces are not stackable in inventory slots. \n \n \n Name \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n Description \n \n \n Helmets \n Leather or \n Gold Ingots or \n Fire * or \n Iron Ingots or \n Diamonds \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n Leather Cap gives  \nGolden Helmet gives  \nChain Helmet gives  \nIron Helmet gives  \nDiamond Helmet gives   \n \n \n \n Chestplates \n Leather or \n Gold Ingots or \n Fire * or \n Iron Ingots or \n Diamonds \n \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n Leather Tunic gives   \nGolden Chestplate gives    \nChain Chestplate gives    \nIron Chestplate gives    \nDiamond Chestplate gives     \n \n \n \n Leggings \n Leather or \n Gold Ingots or \n Fire * or \n Iron Ingots or \n Diamonds \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n Leather Pants give  \nGolden Leggings give   \nChain Leggings give   \nIron Leggings give    \nDiamond Leggings give    \n \n \n \n Boots \n Leather or \n Gold Ingots or \n Fire * or \n Iron Ingots or \n Diamonds \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n    \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n Leather Boots give  \nGolden Boots give  \nChain Boots give  \nIron Boots give  \nDiamond Boots give   \n \n \n \n * Fire is only obtainable via inventory hacking . \n [ edit ] Data values \n The following are the data values for each armor piece: \n \n \n Material \n Helmet \n Chestplate \n Leggings \n Boots \n \n \n Leather \n 298 \n 299 \n 300 \n 301 \n \n \n Chain \n 302 \n 303 \n 304 \n 305 \n \n \n Iron \n 306 \n 307 \n 308 \n 309 \n \n \n Diamond \n 310 \n 311 \n 312 \n 313 \n \n \n Gold \n 314 \n 315 \n 316 \n 317 \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n Alpha 1.0.8 \n Before this update, wool armor was the lowest tier of armor, rather than leather armor. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.9pre1 \n Before 1.9pre1, all helmets gave   (0.30 efficiency), all chest armor gave    (0.50 efficiency), all leg armor gave    (0.43 efficiency), and all boots gave   (0.38 efficiency). Armor\'s effectiveness was linked to durability, with lower tier materials less durable than higher tier materials. Leather armor was as protective as diamond armor when undamaged, but leather armor quickly lost durability to attacks, thus its defense power would more rapidly diminish. Likewise, if you put on almost fully decreased boots when you had other armor on, it lowered your armor protection. \n \n \n Also before 1.9 Prerelease 1 , specific types of damage were reduced by a certain amount based upon the effective armor points of the player. Each point of armor reduced the damage you took by 8%, up to the maximum reduction of 80%. \n \n \n 1.9pre4 \n Armor can be enchanted. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0 \n There was a bug that caused all armor to be twice as effective at reducing damage as intended. This was fixed in Minecraft 1.1. \n \n \n 1.1 \n Iron armor naturally generates in NPC village chests. \n \n \n 1.2 \n Zombies can now drop iron helmets on rare occasions, and Zombie Pigmen can drop golden helmets. \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w15a \n Jeb mentioned that shift-clicking armor into armor slots was " on the list of things to do .", [2] and it was later added in weekly snapshot 12w15a. \n \n \n 12w21a \n Chain armor is now obtainable legitimately in survival mode through trading with blacksmith villagers . \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w32a \n A partial or full set of any armor is sometimes worn by zombies , skeletons and Zombie Pigmen , likelihood increasing with difficulty. \n \n \n Jeb and Dinnerbone tweeted pictures of dyable leather armor. \n \n \n 12w34a \n Leather armor can now be dyed. The dye can be removed by right-clicking a full cauldron . \n \n \n Leather armor texture is changed to a darker one, and has been modified in the inventory tooltip. \n \n \n 12w34b \n Leather armor texture slightly changed again. Leather armor sleeves are extended by one pixel. Their item texture has been changed to match the new texture. \n \n \n 12w36a \n Leather armor now uses two overlayed textures, one being the color. \n \n \n 12w37a \n Leather armor now has a non-dyed base layer. \n \n \n 12w41a \n If you wear any helmet, an anvil can fall from any height and you will always take 6 (   ) health points of damage. \n \n \n 1.4.6 \n 12w50a \n Protection isn\'t as effective on armor as the other protection enchantments combined. \n \n \n Thorns can be enchanted on chestplates. \n \n \n 1.5 \n Armor in your hand can be put on by Right clicking. \n \n \n [ edit ] Mob armor \n In Survival Test , certain zombies and skeletons could be found wearing armor; a chestplate or a helmet. Zombies had the potential, although extremely unlikely, to wear both a chestplate and a helmet at the same time. Skeletons could also be found wearing armor, albeit extremely infrequently. Mob armor was purely cosmetic; however, it is possible that it was a planned feature to increase hostile mob difficulty . The armor was soon removed. \n In 12w32a, mob armor was reintroduced. Zombies and skeletons sometimes wear armor in Normal or Hard, increased likelihood in Hard. This can be any tier of armor, including chain armor . Zombie Pigmen can wear armor too. The armor can be dyed, or enchanted rarely. \n In 1.6, horses can wear an armor type called horse armor . Donkeys cannot, however. Horses are more for battling than donkeys are. The horse armor comes in 3 variations; iron, gold, and diamond, and, unlike the other rules for gold, gold horse armor is stronger than iron. However, diamond still beats them all. Horse armor cannot be crafted now. \n \n [ edit ] Mob "armor" \n Other mobs do have armor values built in. \n \n Sheep have wool unless they are sheared. \n Pigs can wear saddles, which is also "armor". \n Snow Golems have pumpkins worn on their heads as helmets. \n When a creeper is struck by lightning, it will become a charged creeper. Charged creepers have an electric glow around them, which provides no health, but makes the creeper\'s explosion twice as big in diameter. \n The wither will develop a shield when it is about halfway defeated, which will make it immune to arrows. \n A tamed wolf\'s collar is considered armor, and will still be seen even with invisibility potions, like all armor. \n The dead pig flesh on a zombie pigman\'s head is 3d, and is seen as armor, even though it goes invisible with invisibility potions. \n \n The most armor a mob can have without using MCEdit or another external editing program is 88%, unless the armor is enchanted. \n [ edit ] Leather-chain armor \n \n \n \n  \nLeather chain armor, as it appeared \n \n \n The leather-chain armor is a sprite from Indev 0.31\'s items.png file, along with the Quiver. In this version, all of the armor seen are only sprites. Usable and craft-able armor were added later, but leather-chain armor never made it to release versions. \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Mobs that burn when exposed to sunlight will be unaffected by day if they have a helmet of any type. However, their helmet\'s durability will soar down. \n If you are sitting in a boat or minecart with armor leggings on, and press E (for your Inventory), or press F5 (for third person view ), your legs will be in a sitting position, but your armor will be a standing position. This can be fixed by un-equipping any bottom piece of armor and then re-equipping them. \n On Halloween, zombies , skeletons , zombie pigmen , and wither skeletons have a relatively large chance of spawning wearing a pumpkin , and a smaller chance of spawning with a jack-o-lantern . \n Gold is the only armor not obtainable in villager trading. Butchers give leather, and the blacksmith just about every other type. \n It is rarer to get chain armor in villager trading than diamond or iron, even though chain is weaker than both. \n Leather armor represents what would be wood armor, and chain represents what would be stone armor. \n \n [ edit ] Leather \n \n Helmets, chestplates, and leggings have different names when they are made of leather. Helmets are called caps, chestplates are called tunics, and leggings are called pants. Boots do not change. \n In the armor folder inside minecraft.jar , leather armor is called cloth armor. This is because leather armor was initially made from cloth (later renamed to Wool ). \n The leather armor design, armor \'mannequin\' outlines, and apple and iron sword sprites, were also used in Notch \'s RPG Legend of the Chambered . \n \n [ edit ] Chain \n \n Chain armor is unique in that it is the only default armor with large amounts of transparency within the armor. Every other pixel is transparent, except for the front of the head, which has a clear space for the face, and other areas which have no covering. \n Chain armor has longer sleeves than other chestplates, by one pixel. \n The chain helmet covers all sides of the head completely except the face unlike most helmets where the face has a nose guard and covers the sides of the head partially. \n \n [ edit ] Pocket Edition \n \n Armor was not legitimately obtainable until version Alpha 0.6.0. A set of illegitimate armor could be hacked in, but would crash the game when tapped on, regardless of being in the player\'s inventory or a chest . If a chest containing it was broken, and the armor picked up, the game would crash. The illegitimate armor still crashes the game in 0.6.1, and looks exactly like normal armor except for the red background. \n Armor is sometimes not lost when the player dies. \n Leather armor was released with the old texture, even though the new texture was released for PC before it. \n Chain armor exists but is unobtainable. It can however be worn. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The armor sprite as it appeared in one of Notch\'s previous projects, Legend of Chambered \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A zombie wearing a chestplate in Survival Test \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A zombie wearing a helmet in Survival Test \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dinnerbone \'s first screenshot of dyed armor \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Leather armor dyed pink in snapshot 12w34a \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A glitch that caused dyed armor to "dye" held items \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A guide for leather armor \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A guide for gold armor \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A guide for iron and diamond armor \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n New leather armor texture in snapshot 12w37a \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n As of Snapshot 12w21a and 1.3.1, you can get chain armor from trading with the villagers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Zombies and skeletons have a chance of spawning with chain armor, as of Snapshot 12w32a. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A zombie wearing chain armor. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Armor as it appears in Minecraft Pocket Edition 0.6.0 Alpha. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The old leather armour texture.

Third person view can be activated by pressing F5 . Pressing F5 once, twice, and three times gives you the vantage point from behind the player, in front of the player, and at normal eye level, respectively. Note that for some laptops and notebooks, the fn key may need to be help whilst pressing the F5 key for this to work. The feature was introduced in Indev versions (without face view). It can be used for viewing the player, making videos, and other uses. \n The keys Y , H , U , O , I , K , J , L , N , and M are used as a debugging feature called the "deadmau5 camera" (in the code) to manipulate the view and are normally disabled. Pressing F9 freezes the view while pressing two functionally connected keys at the same time (example: Y + H ) reverts the view back to normal (but U + O doesn\'t work). Also, if the Player were to go in a 1*2*1 hole and press F5 and F9 , then the player can see underground structures. As of 1.2.1, the sides of the player\'s head may be shown when rotating the view. This debugging feature doesn\'t actually help much, and was only added for deadmau5 . [1] \n Because mobs look at the camera and not the player\'s head, in third person view, they do not look at the player\'s head, but rather at the camera itself. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Video \n 2 History \n 3 Trivia \n 4 Gallery \n 5 See also \n 6 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n When Indev 0.31 was introduced, Notch made the new inventory , and when it was open, you could not see the player , just a black square. this was changed in Indev February 18 , so that the player can be seen there. \n In Alpha 1.0.14 , pressing F5 gave you a strange camera position in third person, where the camera would be off-center by one block to the left; this was later fixed in Alpha 1.0.15 . \n In the Halloween Update ( Alpha 1.2.0 ) a new feature was added, where holding F1 down hides the HUD, as well as meaning that pressing F5 and then holding F1 would move the view to the front of the player and hide the HUD. This feature was removed in Beta 1.3 , but was reimplemented in Minecraft 1.0. \n As of Minecraft 1.0, pressing F5 twice switches the camera to a face view, pressing F5 three times switches it back into first person view. \n The debugging view manipulation feature was accidentally enabled in Beta 1.9pre5 snapshot and 12w08a , and was disabled in subsequent updates, 1.9pre6 and 1.2 Preview.

On newly-generated maps , water is common at ocean level also known as sea level (elevation 62) in the form of lakes . It also appears in pools, springs underground and lakes above ground. It can also be found in Village Wells, Desert Wells and sometimes as Springs / Waterfalls from a cliffside. \n Water cannot be found in The Nether and water from a bucket will evaporate as soon as it touches anything in there ( cauldrons excepted). Water " blocks " obtained through inventory editing can still be placed in The Nether. \n Water reduces light by 2 for every block, in addition to normal dispersion. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Spreading \n 2 Management \n 3 Springs \n 4 Infinite water source \n 5 Usage \n \n 5.1 Fire extinguisher \n 5.2 Cobblestone Generator \n 5.3 Stone Generator \n 5.4 Water for Obsidian \n 5.5 Water for clearing tall grass \n 5.6 Water as blast controller \n 5.7 Underwater bases/shelters \n 5.8 Transportation \n \n 5.8.1 Water Elevators \n 5.8.2 Jumping off Structures \n 5.8.3 Water Brake \n 5.8.4 Water Tram \n \n \n \n \n 6 Water Bucket \n 7 Videos \n 8 History \n 9 Issues \n 10 Trivia \n 11 Gallery \n 12 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Spreading \n \n \n \n  \nA lake. \n \n \n Water spreads across surfaces in a slightly more realistic way but cannot spread on top of another Water block. This allows the creation of waterfalls in these modes. The player can pick up Water blocks from sources such as an ocean or a lake by use of a Bucket . When placed again, the Water creates a spring which generates flowing or falling water. When a spring is destroyed, all flowing water created from it will slowly dry up. If there is a hole six blocks or fewer from the point of origin, the water will tend to flow in that direction. Source blocks and falling water that has landed on a solid block will always flow in at least one direction unless restricted. Water will travel a distance of 7 tiles with the counter resetting to 0 every time it lands on a lower level. If a block next to a water source block is destroyed, the water will immediately flow in that direction unless there was a block beneath the destroyed block. \n [ edit ] Management \n Placing a block in the same space as water will replace the water. Entire lakes can be filled this way. Some Decorations , Piston \'s head, Ladders and Sugar Cane will also displace water. In survival mode, blocks take a longer time to break while the player is underwater. \n Using a redstone wire , a one-block water flow can be redirected by supplying power to the source block, which will cause it to reset the flow towards the now-nearest terrain depression. The flow can then be put back so that it is not redirected until a block change occurs again, as seen in this video . This re-calculation is made because redstone wire when toggled changes the block from redstone (on), to redstone (off). whenever a block updates on any side of water, the water re-calculates where to flow, but does not cut off its current direction of flow. By using the fact that flowing water destroys torches, it is even possible to create multi-usable water toggles, as seen in this video . \n Water can flow up to seven blocks away. (Eight blocks if you count the source block.) \n [ edit ] Springs \n Springs can consist of either Water or Lava . Springs are randomly generated in caverns underground and sometimes above ground. Springs can also be placed by the player by picking up Water from the ocean by use of a bucket and then placing the Water again. A spring will generate Water which cannot flood a room because Water cannot spread into a space that is not bordered horizontally by at least two water source blocks. If a spring is removed, all Water that was created from it will also be removed (unless it spread a source block into a horizontally adjacent block), which makes it hard for things to be ruined by springs (with the exception of fragile, non-solid blocks like torches). \n [ edit ] Infinite water source \n \n \n \n  \nA 2x2 infinite water source. Water can be taken from any corner. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nA 3x1 infinite water source. \n \n \n An infinite water source is an endless supply of water, created naturally or by the player, where infinite water source blocks form on top of a water source block or another block. All naturally occurring bodies of water can be used as infinite water sources, including oceans, rivers, lakes and wells. Underground Springs are not an infinite water source. Whenever the player uses a bucket to scoop water out of this source, it will just fill back up again. \n The easiest and smallest infinite water sources are made by making a 2x2 square of water, or a 3x1 rectangle of water, only retaking the center square. Another design is to make a 3x3 square that is one block deep, filling in three of the corners. A less efficient design is to dig a \'+\' shape and place 4 water blocks in the 4 \'arms\', making the middle an infinite water source. \n Infinite water sources are possible in Minecraft because any block of flowing water which is horizontally adjacent to two or more water source blocks will become a water source block, as long as the block underneath is either a solid block or a water source block. \n [ edit ] Usage \n [ edit ] Fire extinguisher \n Water will destroy any fire block it flows into, and will also extinguish burning players or mobs. It will also destroy lava in many situations (not all). Also, dumping water while in the lava can get the player trapped under the resulting obsidian or cobblestone . \n [ edit ] Cobblestone Generator \n If the flowing water and flowing lava blocks collide on the same level or flowing water falls onto flowing lava, cobblestone will be created and regenerated in the same spot whenever mined, providing a 100% renewable way of collecting cobblestone. \n This will not work with source blocks, as a water source block affected by lava will turn into stone and lava source blocks affected by water will turn into obsidian with no chance of retrieving the liquid for either case. \n [ edit ] Stone Generator \n If flowing lava falls onto flowing water, or a water source block, stone will be created and regenerated in the same spot whenever mined. When used in combination with a pickaxe enchanted with Silk Touch , this will provide a renewable source of stone and forgo the process of cooking cobblestone to create stone blocks. \n [ edit ] Water for Obsidian \n Water can be used for making obsidian . If flowing water hits lava source blocks (not flowing lava blocks), the lava source blocks will turn into obsidian. Obsidian can only be mined using a diamond pickaxe . \n [ edit ] Water for clearing tall grass \n Water can be used for flushing away tall grass for building. This is also an efficient way to harvest Seeds and to gather rails from abandoned mine shafts . \n [ edit ] Water as blast controller \n Water has 500 blast resistance . If a layer of water exists between a destructible block and common types of explosions , the water will absorb the force of the blast, and the block will not be destroyed. \n A one-block-thick water screen will stop most explosions, such as from creepers , from reaching the other side. However, a player laying multiple blocks of TNT should mind the placement of the explosives, as primed TNT entities may launch each other through the water screen. \n [ edit ] Underwater bases/shelters \n If the player digs 3 blocks down into the bottom of a lake/water body, then digs into the wall of the hole (at least two blocks high), an underwater base can be made. To stop the water from flooding the base, dig the hole through which you enter 1 block deeper than the base\'s floor. Also, if you want to mine underwater, you can prevent drowning by digging a three block deep hole underwater, then going into the hole and covering the top with any material that blocks the flow of water. Alternatively, players may dig into walls or use signs to create air pockets. The hole will drain, because the water in that hole is flowing water, not a water source block. Cutting off the flowing water from the water source blocks the ocean is made of will drain the hole. If you wish to make a base on land that is hidden by water (to minimize theft or griefing in multi-player), you can use this method: Find a lake or body of water. Go to the bottom, and dig a 1 block hole as deep as you want it to be, then fill the hole with ladders. The ladders will eliminate the water, and you can jump in the lake and climb in and out of the hole (Though in order to climb out, you must hold the space bar when you reach the top of the hole in order to swim to the surface of the lake) Once you have filled the hole with ladders, you can dig/mine a cavern as large as you wish. You can use this cavern as your home or a base. \n [ edit ] Transportation \n [ edit ] Water Elevators \n \n Main article: Water Elevator \n \n A source block placed high above the ground will form a waterfall. (In Classic , a similar effect could be managed with sponges .) These can be used to swim safely up or down a great height. Since Infdev , swimming halfway off of a falling-water tile (that is, "on the edge" of the waterfall) lets a player avoid damage from drowning while swimming up or down. \n [ edit ] Jumping off Structures \n Water can be used to jump off of buildings and structures that would otherwise kill you by building a pool to land into. For each sixteen blocks of altitude the water must be one block deep, if the jump altitude is higher than sixteen blocks and the water is only one deep damage is taken from the total altitude minus sixteen (19 is safe). This can be used along with water elevators to enter and exit a very deep mineshaft or cave in a matter of seconds, saving time, and also saving the wood and stone otherwise used to make ladders and steps. It is recommended that you make a fairly wide pool in case you hit the edge and die. You can also hold the jump key to land in water only 1 block deep if necessary. \n [ edit ] Water Brake \n Alternatively, you can create a floating "water brake", using water held in mid-air with ladders , signs , or other non-solid blocks that resist water. Two or three blocks above the bottom of your vertical mineshaft, place a ladder to support the water block, then place the water block above the ladder. The way this works is that when the player collides with the water, it reverts the falling distance to zero and slows the player\'s downward velocity dramatically. The player can then safely land on the solid floor in a 2 block high air pocket under the water without taking fall damage or having to swim. \n [ edit ] Water Tram \n \n Main article: Water Tram \n \n Road-like canals can be built with flowing water contained by signs , pressure plates , or similar blocks. This provides horizontal transportation by boat that is significantly faster than sprinting. \n [ edit ] Water Bucket \n \n Water Bucket \n \n   \n \n \n \n Type \n \n Tools \n \n \n \n Durability \n \n N/A \n \n \n \n Renewable \n \n Yes \n \n \n \n Stackable \n \n No \n \n \n \n First appearance \n \n Infdev (June 15, 2010) \n \n \n \n Data value \n \n dec : &#160;326 hex : &#160;146 bin : &#160;000101000110 \n \n \n \n \n Water can be collected by right clicking on a water block with a bucket , giving a water bucket . However only water spring/source blocks can be collected, not shallow flowing water. \n [ edit ] Videos \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Note: The video states that "Infinite water sources are found all over the world in shallower areas." Ever since the 1.5 update, this is no longer the case - water source blocks form even if there isn\'t a solid block under them, meaning even deep bodies of water can be used as infinite water sources. \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Classic \n \n \n 0.0.19a \n The texture for water was changed, adding animation. \n \n \n Sponges added, removing water. \n \n \n Indev \n \n \n Indev \n New water implementation, added springs and lakes. \n \n \n Infdev \n \n \n June 15, 2010 \n Buckets can be used to place water. \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.2.6 \n Lakes were added. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.2 \n Squid were added, being the first and only water mob. \n \n \n 1.5 \n Dropped items in flowing water now move faster. \n \n \n 1.6 \n Rain and snow would not fall through water. \n \n \n 1.8 \n Because of the change in how land is generated, if a player is in a world that was made pre-1.8 and travels into new chunks, there\'s a chance that a very, very large ocean may be formed as the Ocean biome. There will also be a one-block-high drop in sea level along the discontinuity between the old and new chunks with the old chunks being higher. \n \n \n Water can be found in the farms and the well in villages. \n \n \n Two biomes were added that are almost all water: Ocean and River. \n \n \n 1.9pre4 \n Respiration and Aqua Affinity enchantments added, which allow more breathing time in water and normal digging speed in water (without it, blocks take longer to break). \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0.0 \n One-block ceilings of opaque blocks immediately below water will have a "leak" particle effect (as with Lava ), alerting the player that digging that block will unleash a torrent of water. Glass or any other transparent block is exempt from this. \n \n \n 1.2.1 \n 12w04a \n Desert Wells have one block of water in them. \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w15a \n Dispensers can dispense water. \n \n \n 12w17a \n Removed ability to bring water (using ice) into the nether. \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w38a \n Changed sound when jumping and swimming in water. \n \n \n 1.4.3pre \n Changed falling damage rule. Players and mobs do not die from great heights in shallow water. [1] \n \n \n 1.5 \n 13w03a \n Water source blocks form even if there isn\'t a solid block under them. \n \n \n 13w04a \n Flowing water in creative mode no longer slows you down. \n \n \n 1.6 \n 13w17a \n Water lakes don\'t generate in deserts anymore. \n \n \n [ edit ] Issues \n Issues relating to "Water" are maintained on Mojira. Report issues there. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Zombies and Skeletons can survive daylight if they are in water. \n Endermen take damage, teleport, and become neutral when in contact with water. This makes water buckets useful for if you have accidentally angered an Enderman. \n The texture for water is generated procedurally - there is no animated water texture in minecraft.jar, nor in the terrain.png inside. \n Blocks under water will only take longer to break if your head is under water. If your head is above water the block will be destroyed at normal speed if you are touching the ground. \n If you sneak while in water, you will be as slow as if you were swimming in lava. \n In Classic, water flows without animation. This means it\'s infinite unless a player blocks the water. \n With the /give command, you can get the water block itself. This doesn\'t affect the physics similar to fire in which you can get the actual fire block. Also, if you have the water block and place it in the Nether, you can use water normally (but only if you have the block, NOT a water bucket). \n While underwater, the player\'s FOV is lowered by 10 to simulate light refraction. \n If there is a block in the water without a water source block directly beneath it, there is a small pocket of air beneath it. If a player swims up while underneath this block and holds the space bar, a glitch may occur; the water itself will look like air and will no longer seem to block light while holding the space bar. This glitch allows a clear view of the ocean floor, and also applies to lava. This glitch is client-side only, and may cause drowning in multiplayer. \n Blocks take 5 times as long to break if the player is underwater, and 25 times as long if they are both underwater and not touching the ground if you can get the drop by mining it. \n If you have a waterfall with no blocks directly next to it on any side (diagonal is OK), you move faster up the waterfall. Signs, ladders, etc. are declared "blocks" in this case, and will make you move slower. In other words, the pattern below will make you move faster up a waterfall (and slightly slower down the waterfall). As long as you maintain the four air blocks around the water, you will move faster upwards. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n There is an uncommon glitch where in the ocean, there are large floating air pockets without signs or fenceposts to create them. \n Since 1.8, particles can be seen throughout the water. This is most noticeable underwater, but can also be seen above. The particles suspended in water are the same as the particles seen near bedrock level. \n Prior to 1.0.0, the Silk Touch enchantment could be used to gather ice in Survival mode and bring it to the Nether, making it perfectly possible to bring water to the Nether. \n Briefly in 1.9 Prerelease 5 both water and lava would appear when surrounded horizontally by four source blocks, regardless of the block underneath. Additionally water would form source blocks underneath new source blocks, creating pillars as far down as it could go unobstructed. \n As of 1.9 Prerelease 6, when water is not beneath any block, it will freeze in snowy biomes. However, breaking the ice block will still release water. \n Water flows at 0.25 seconds per block (1/4 second/Block), taking it approximately 1.75 second to reach the maximum water range on a flat surface (7 blocks excluding the source). \n The only hostile mobs to be able to swim/ford upstream towards the player are cave spiders and normal spiders. The rest do not have enough strength and are swept downstream. \n If you look at water from a distance it will appear to be vibrating. \n Sometimes a mob may get stuck in vertically flowing water, causing it to drown and die. \n Before version 1.3.1, it was possible to drown in a 3 block deep water pool if the player is unable to place blocks. The knock-back of water damage will keep the player from swimming up. \n In Peaceful mode, it takes twice as long to drown because of the constant regeneration of health. \n You can make a "water block" by placing four Glass Panes around water. This will let you see the water in a 3D shape of a cube. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n 1.8 underwater particles, or "bubbles." \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n A "leaky" roof.

For the 2013 April Fools\' day "Minecraft 2.0" version, see Chunk format/April Fools\' 2013 . \n Chunks store the terrain and entities within a 16x256x16 area. They also store precomputed lighting, heightmap data for Minecraft\'s performance, and other meta information. \n Chunks were first introduced in Minecraft Infdev . Before the addition of the MCRegion format in Beta 1.3, chunks were stored as individual chunk files ".dat" where the file names contained the chunk\'s position encoded in Base36 - this is known as the Alpha level format . MCRegion changed this by storing groups of 32x32 chunks in individual ".mcr" files with the coordinates in Base10, with the goal being to reduce disk usage by cutting down on the number of file handles Minecraft had open at once. MCRegion\'s successor is the current format, Anvil , which only made changes to the chunk format . The region file technique is still used, but the region file extensions are ".mca" instead. \n The major change from MCRegion to Anvil was the division of Chunks into Sections; each chunk has up to 16 individual 16x16x16 block Sections so that completely empty sections will not be saved at all. Preparation has also been made to support blocks with IDs in the range 0 to 4095, as compared to the previous 0 to 255 limitation. However, Minecraft is not fully prepared for such blocks to exist as items; many item IDs are already taken in the range 256 to 4095. \n The Blocks, Data, BlockLight, and SkyLight arrays are now housed in individual chunk Sections. The Data, SkyLight, and BlockLight are arrays of 4-bit values, and the BlockLight and SkyLight arrays no longer house part of the block ID. The Blocks array is 8 bits per block, and the 4096-blocks support exists in the form of an optional Add byte array of 4-bits per block for additional block ID information. With the Anvil format, the NBT Format was changed from Notch\'s original specification to include an integer array tag similar to the existing byte array tag. It is currently only used for HeightMap information in chunks. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 NBT Structure \n 2 Block Format \n 3 Entity Format \n \n 3.1 Mobs \n 3.2 Projectiles \n 3.3 Items \n 3.4 Vehicles \n 3.5 Dynamic Tiles \n 3.6 Other \n \n \n 4 Tile Entity Format \n 5 Tile Tick Format \n 6 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] NBT Structure \n \n See also: Information from the Anvil format page \n \n Chunks are stored in NBT format, with this structure: \n \n \n   The root tag.\n \n  &#160; Level : Chunk data.\n \n  &#160; xPos : X position of the chunk. \n  &#160; zPos : Z position of the chunk. \n  &#160; LastUpdate : Tick when the chunk was last saved. \n  &#160; TerrainPopulated : 1 or not present (true/false) indicate whether the terrain in this chunk was populated with special things. (Ores, special blocks, trees, dungeons, flowers, waterfalls, etc.) If set to zero then Minecraft will regenerate these features in the blocks that already exist. \n  &#160; InhabitedTime : Future use for difficulty. \n  &#160; Biomes : May not exist. 256 bytes of biome data, one byte for each vertical column in the chunk. See Data Values for biome IDs. If this tag does not exist it will be created and filled by Minecraft when the chunk is loaded and saved. If any values in this array are -1, Minecraft will also set them to the correct biome. \n  &#160; HeightMap : 1024 bytes(256 TAG_Int) of heightmap data. 16 x 16. Each byte records the lowest level in each column where the light from the sky is at full strength. Speeds computing of the SkyLight. Note: This array\'s indexes are ordered ZX whereas the other array indexes are ordered XZ or YZX. \n  &#160; Sections : List of Compound tags, each tag is a sub-chunk of sorts.\n \n  &#160; Y : The Y index (not coordinate) of this section. Range 0 to 15 (bottom to top), with no duplicates but some sections may be missing if empty. \n  &#160; Blocks : 4096 bytes of block IDs defining the terrain. 8 bits per block, plus the bits from the below Add tag. 3D order YZX. \n  &#160; Add : May not exist. 2048 bytes of additional block ID data. The value to add to (combine with) the above block ID to form the true block ID in the range 0 to 4095. 4 bits per block. 3D order YZX. Combining is done by shifting this value to the left 8 bits and then adding it to the block ID from above. \n  &#160; Data : 2048 bytes of block data additionally defining parts of the terrain. 4 bits per block. 3D order YZX. \n  &#160; BlockLight : 2048 bytes recording the amount of block-emitted light in each block. Makes load times faster compared to recomputing at load time. 4 bits per block. 3D order YZX. \n  &#160; SkyLight : 2048 bytes recording the amount of sunlight or moonlight hitting each block. 4 bits per block. 3D order YZX. \n \n \n  &#160; Entities : Each TAG_Compound in this list defines an entity in the chunk. See Entity Format below. If this list is empty it will be a list of Byte tags. \n  &#160; TileEntities : Each TAG_Compound in this list defines a tile entity in the chunk. See Tile Entity Format below. If this list is empty it will be a list of Byte tags. \n  &#160; TileTicks : May not exist. Each TAG_Compound in this list is an "active" block in this chunk waiting to be updated. These are used to save the state of redstone machines, falling sand or water, and other activity. See Tile Tick Format below. This tag may not exist. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Block Format \n In the Anvil format, block positions are ordered YZX for compression purposes. \n The coordinate system is as follows: \n \n X increases East, decreases West \n Y increases upwards, decreases downwards \n Z increases South, decreases North \n \n Each section in a chunk is a 16x16x16-block area, with up to 16 sections in a chunk. Section 0 is the bottom section of the chunk, and section 15 is the top section of the chunk. To save space, completely empty sections are not saved. Within each section is a byte tag "Y" for the Y index of the section, 0 to 15, and then byte arrays for the blocks. The "Block" byte array has 4096 partial block IDs at 8 bits per block. Another byte array "Add" is used for block with IDs over 255, and is 2048 bytes of the other part of the 4096 block IDs at 4 bits per block. When both the "Block" and "Add" byte arrays exist, the partial ID from the "Add" array is shifted left 8 bits and added to the partial ID from the "Blocks" array to form the true Block ID. The "Data" byte array is also 2048 bytes for 4096 block data values at 4 bits per block. The "BlockLight" and "SkyLight" byte arrays are the same as the "Data" byte array but they are used for block light levels and sky light levels respectively. The "SkyLight" values represent how much sunlight or moonlight can potentially reach the block, independent of the current light level of the sky. \n The pseudo-code below shows how to access individual block information from a single section. Hover over text to see additional information or comments. \n \n byte Nibble4( byte [] arr, int index) { return index%2 == 0 ? arr[index/2]&amp;0x0F : (arr[index/2]&gt;&gt;4)&amp;0x0F ; }\n int BlockPos = y * 16 * 16 + z* 16 + x;\n byte BlockID_a = Blocks [BlockPos];\n byte BlockID_b = Nibble4( Add , BlockPos);\n short BlockID = BlockID_a + (BlockID_b &lt;&lt; 8) ;\n byte BlockData = Nibble4( Data , BlockPos);\n byte Blocklight = Nibble4( BlockLight , BlockPos);\n byte Skylight = Nibble4( SkyLight , BlockPos);\n \n [ edit ] Entity Format \n Every entity is an unnamed TAG_Compound contained in the Entities list of a chunk file. The sole exception is the Player entity, stored in level.dat , or in &lt;player&gt;.dat files on servers. All entities share this base: \n \n \n   Entity data\n \n  &#160; id : Entity ID. This tag does not exist for the Player entity. \n  &#160; Pos : 3 TAG_Doubles describing the current X,Y,Z position of the entity. \n  &#160; Motion : 3 TAG_Doubles describing the current dX,dY,dZ velocity of the entity in meters per tick. \n  &#160; Rotation : Two TAG_Floats representing rotation in degrees.\n \n   The entity\'s rotation clockwise around the Y axis (called yaw). Due west is 0. Does not exceed 360 degrees. \n   The entity\'s declination from the horizon (called pitch). Horizontal is 0. Positive values look downward. Does not exceed positive or negative 90 degrees. \n \n \n  &#160; FallDistance : Distance the entity has fallen. Larger values cause more damage when the entity lands. \n  &#160; Fire : Number of ticks until the fire is put out. Negative values reflect how long the entity can stand in fire before burning. Default -1 when not on fire. \n  &#160; Air : How much air the entity has, in ticks. Fills to a maximum of 300 in air, giving 15 seconds submerged before the entity starts to drown, and a total of up to 35 seconds before the entity dies (if it has 20 health). Decreases while underwater. If 0 while underwater, the entity loses 1 health per second. \n  &#160; OnGround : 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the entity is touching the ground. \n  &#160; Dimension : Unknown usage; entities are only saved in the region files for the dimension they are in. -1 for The Nether , 0 for The Overworld , and 1 for The End . \n  &#160; Invulnerable : 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the entity should not take damage. This applies to living and nonliving entities alike: mobs will not take damage from any source (including potion effects) and objects such as vehicles and item frames cannot be destroyed unless their supports are removed. Note that these entities also cannot be moved by fishing rods, attacks, explosions, or projectiles. \n  &#160; PortalCooldown : The number of ticks before which the entity may be teleported back through a portal of any kind. Initially starts at 900 ticks (45 seconds) after teleportation and counts down to 0. \n  &#160; UUIDMost : The most significant bits of this entity\'s Universally Unique IDentifier . This is joined with UUIDLeast to form this entity\'s unique ID. \n  &#160; UUIDLeast : The least significant bits of this entity\'s Universally Unique IDentifier . \n  &#160; Riding : The data of the entity being ridden. Note that if an entity is being ridden, the topmost entity in the stack has the Pos tag, and the coordinates specify the location of the bottommost entity. Also note that the bottommost entity controls movement, while the topmost entity determines spawning conditions when created by a mob spawner.\n \n See this format (recursive). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Mobs \n Mobs are a subclass of Entity with additional tags to store their health, attacking/damaged state, potion effects, and more depending on the mob.

The name of this container, which will display in its GUI where the default name ordinarily is. For Command Blocks , the name will replace the usual \'@\' when using commands such as "say" and "tell". \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Beacon has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; Levels : The number of levels available from the pyramid. \n  &#160; Primary : The primary power selected, see Potion effects for IDs. 0 means none. \n  &#160; Secondary : The secondary power selected, see Potion effects for IDs. 0 means none. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Cauldron has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; Items : List of items in the brewing stand.\n \n  : An item, including the slot tag. Slots are numbered 0 to 3.\n \n See Item Format . \n \n \n \n \n  &#160; BrewTime : The number of ticks the potions have been brewing for. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Chest has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; Items : List of items in the chest.

Chest slots are numbered 0-26 with 0 in the top left corner.\n \n See Item Format . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n Double chests are simply two Chest tile entities next to each other; see Chest for which tile entity is which half of the chest. \n \n \n \n \n  Comparator has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; OutputSignal : Represents the strength of the analog signal output by this redstone comparator. Likely used because the block itself uses its four bits of metadata to determine its rotation, powered state, and subtraction mode state, and comparators can hold a specific amount of power even in circuits without redstone wire. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Control has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; Command : The command to issue to the server. \n  &#160; SuccessCount : Represents the strength of the analog signal output by redstone comparators attached to this command block. Only updated when the command block is activated with a redstone signal. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Furnace has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; BurnTime : Number of ticks left before the current fuel runs out. [note 1] \n  &#160; CookTime : Number of ticks the item has been smelting for. The item finishes smelting when this value reaches 200 (10 seconds). Is reset to 0 if BurnTime reaches 0. \n  &#160; Items : List of items in the furnace slots.\n \n  : An item in the furnace, including the slot tag: \nSlot 0: The item(s) being smelted. \nSlot 1: The item(s) to use as the next fuel source. \nSlot 2: The item(s) in the result slot.\n \n See Item Format . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n The original maximum burning time for the current fuel isn\'t stored, thus the current time left is assumed to be the maximum when this Tile Entity is loaded into memory. \n \n \n \n \n  Hopper has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; Items : List of items in the hopper slots.\n \n  : An item in the hopper, including the slot tag.\n \n See Item Format . \n \n \n \n \n  &#160; TransferCooldown : Time unil the next transfer, naturaly between 1 and 8 or 0 if there is no transfer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  MobSpawner has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; SpawnPotentials : Optional. List of possible entities to spawn. [2] [3] If this tag does not exist, but SpawnData exists, Minecraft will generate it the next time the spawner tries to spawn an entity. The generated list will contain a single entry derived from the EntityId and SpawnData tags.\n \n  : A potential future spawn. After the spawner makes an attempt at spawning, it will choose one of these entries at random and use it to prepare for the next spawn.\n \n  &#160; Type : Overwrites EntityId when preparing the next spawn. \n  &#160; Weight : The chance that this spawn will be picked as compared to other spawn weights. Must be non-negative and at least 1. \n  &#160; Properties : Overwrites the contents of SpawnData when preparing the next spawn. Not optional; an empty one will be created if it does not exist. \n \n \n \n \n  &#160; EntityId : The Entity ID of the next entity(s) to spawn. Both Mob Entity IDs and other Entity IDs will work. Warning: If SpawnPotentials exists, this tag will get overwritten after the next spawning attempt: see above for more details. \n  &#160; SpawnData : Contains tags to copy to the next spawned entity(s) after spawning. Any of the Entity or Mob tags may be used. Note that if a spawner specifies any of these tags, almost all variable data such as mob equipment, villager profession, sheep wool color, etc., will no longer be automatically generated, and must also be manually specified [4] (note that this does not apply to position data, which will be randomized as normal unless Pos is specified. Similarly, unless Size and Health are specified for a Slime or Magma Cube, these will still be randomized). This, together with EntityId, also determines the appearance of the miniature entity spinning in the spawner cage. Note: this tag is optional: if it does not exist, the next spawned entity will use the default vanilla spawning properties for this mob, including potentially randomized armor (this is true even if SpawnPotentials does exist). Warning: If SpawnPotentials exists, this tag will get overwritten after the next spawning attempt: see above for more details. \n  &#160; SpawnCount : How many mobs to attempt to spawn each time. \n  &#160; SpawnRange : The radius around which the spawner attempts to place mobs randomly. The spawn area is square, includes the block the spawner is in, and is centered around the spawner\'s x,z coordinates - not the spawner itself. It is 2 blocks high, centered around the spawner\'s y coordinate (its bottom), allowing mobs to spawn as high as its top surface and as low as 1 block below its bottom surface. Vertical spawn coordinates are integers, while horizontal coordinates are floating point and weighted towards values near the spawner itself. \n  &#160; Delay : Ticks until next spawn. If 0, it will spawn immediately when a player enters its range. If set to -1 (this state never occurs in a natural spawner; it seems to be a feature accessed only via NBT editing), the spawner will reset its Delay, and (if SpawnPotentials exist) EntityID and SpawnData as though it had just completed a successful spawn cycle, immediately when a player enters its range. Note that setting Delay to -1 can be useful if you want the game to properly randomize the spawner\'s Delay, EntityID, and SpawnData, rather than starting with pre-defined values. \n  &#160; MinSpawnDelay : The minimum random delay for the next spawn delay. May be equal to MaxSpawnDelay. \n  &#160; MaxSpawnDelay : The maximum random delay for the next spawn delay. Warning : Setting this value to 0 crashes Minecraft. Set to at least 1. \n  &#160; MaxNearbyEntities : Overrides the maximum number of nearby (within a box of spawnrange*2+1 x spawnrange*2+1 x 8 centered around the spawner block) entities whose IDs match this spawner\'s entity ID. Note that this is relative to a mob\'s hitbox, not their physical position. Also note that all entities within all chunk sections (16x16x16 cubes) overlapped by this box are tested for their ID and hitbox overlap, rather than just entities which are within the box, meaning a large amount of entities outside the box (or within it, of course) can cause substantial lag. \n  &#160; RequiredPlayerRange : Overrides the block radius of the sphere of activation by players for this spawner. Note that for every gametick, a spawner will check all players in the current world to test whether a player is within this sphere. \n  &#160; MaxExperience  (removed) : Unknown. \n  &#160; RemainingExperience  (removed) : Unknown. \n  &#160; ExperienceRegenTick  (removed) : Unknown. \n  &#160; ExperienceRegenRate  (removed) : Unknown. \n  &#160; ExperienceRegenAmount  (removed) : Unknown. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Music has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; note : Pitch (number of right-clicks). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Piston has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; blockId : Block_IDs of the block being moved. \n  &#160; blockData : Data value of the block being moved. \n  &#160; facing : Direction in which the block will be pushed. \n  &#160; progress : How far the block has been moved. \n  &#160; extending : 1 or 0 (true/false) - true if the block is being pushed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  RecordPlayer has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; Record : Record currently playing. 0 is no record. Otherwise, it is the item ID of the record (e.g. 2261 for the "mall" record). Other IDs can be used to make other items or blocks pop out with a data value of 0. This is always overridden by the ID in RecordItem. \n  &#160; RecordItem : The item, without the Slot tag.\n \n See Item Format . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Sign has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; Text1 : First row of text. \n  &#160; Text2 : Second row of text. \n  &#160; Text3 : Third row of text. \n  &#160; Text4 : Fourth row of text. \n \n \n \n \n Only the first 16 characters of each line are read, the rest are discarded. \n \n \n  Skull has these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; SkullType : The type of the skull, similar to the Item IDs. (See Data values#Heads ) \n  &#160; ExtraType : Name of the player this is a skull of. [5] \n  &#160; Rot : The orientation, similar to signs. (See Data values#Sign_posts ) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Trap and Dropper have these additional fields:\n \n  &#160; Items : List of items in the dispenser/dropper\n \n  : An item, including the slot tag. Slots are numbered 0-8.\n \n See Item Format . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Tile Tick Format \n Tile Ticks represent block updates that need to happen because they could not happen before the chunk was saved. Examples reasons for tile ticks include redstone circuits needing to continue updating, water and lava that should continue flowing, recently placed sand or gravel that should fall, etc. Tile ticks are not used for purposes such as leaf decay, where the decay information is stored in the leaf block data values and handled by Minecraft when the chunk loads. For map makers, tile ticks can be used to update blocks after a period of time has passed with the chunk loaded into memory. \n \n \n   A Tile Tick\n \n  &#160; i : The ID of the block; used to activate the correct block update procedure. \n  &#160; t : The number of ticks until processing should occur. May be negative when processing is overdue. \n  &#160; p : If multiple tile ticks are scheduled for the same tick, tile ticks with lower p will be processed first. If they also have the same p, the order is unknown. \n  &#160; x : X position \n  &#160; y : Y position \n  &#160; z : Z position \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n

It has animated faces on all four sides, and two more faces on the inside in an X shape. Fire makes a crackling sound that can be heard up to 15 blocks away. Fire blocks are only generated naturally in The Nether and in The End (on top of the bedrock that spawns on top of the pillars). The Player can create fire using a flint and steel or a fire charge . Ghasts and Blazes can also create fire, as can lava and lightning . Fire spreads naturally to other nearby flammable blocks, and it can be placed as a block in modded clients. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 As a crafting ingredient \n 2 Behavior \n \n 2.1 Spread \n 2.2 Extinguishing \n \n \n 3 Eternal Fire \n 4 History \n 5 Trivia \n \n 5.1 In Pocket Edition \n \n \n 6 Gallery \n 7 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] As a crafting ingredient \n \n Main article: Chain Armor \n \n Fire is used to craft chain armor, but chain armor can only be legitimately obtained through trading or by killing zombies or skeletons that are wearing chain armor. It is also possible to obtain fire in a player\'s inventory by using the /give command, mods , or an inventory editor. Chain armor is crafted the same way as any other armor, and has slightly more durability than gold armor. \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Fire \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Behavior \n \n \n \n  \nBefore a fire \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDuring a fire \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAfter a fire \n \n \n Fire is not available for use in Classic mode. Flint and steel is one method used to place fire in the environment. When placed, fire will burn for a short and randomly determined amount of time. If nothing flammable is adjacent to it, the flames will not spread, and will die out. Wooden planks , wooden slabs , wood , leaves , vines , tall grass , wool , fences , wooden stairs , and bookshelves are all flammable. If you place a bed in The End or Nether and try to sleep it will explode and create fire. Fire can melt ice , and TNT will detonate if exposed to fire (except in Pocket Edition). Fire will burn leaves slightly faster than the other flammable objects, suggesting the game has coding differences between some different types of flammable blocks. Many blocks do not burn away even though they may appear to catch fire. Two notable block types which do not burn away are wooden chests and crafting tables . \n Mobs and players will catch fire when exposed to fire. Fire will obstruct the player\'s view slightly and they will slowly lose life at a rate of \xc2\xbd heart per second. This is the same rate that the player gains health in peaceful mode, so fire alone will not kill you in this mode. Additionally, if one is wearing diamond armor and has a full hunger bar, said person will lose health slower in the fire block itself than when on fire. \n Fire can be used to damage or kill mobs without causing them to become hostile to the player. Items or blocks falling into fire will catch light and quickly disappear. This trick can be used to dispose of unwanted materials, but it can also destroy valuable drops before they can be retrieved. Lava can set off TNT , but it may take several minutes to do so, and this usually gives time to clear the lava away before the TNT is triggered. \n \n \n \n  \nA natural fire started by lava flowing into a tree \n \n \n If a cow , pig , or chicken dies while taking fire damage , it will drop the cooked version of its usual meat; cows drop cooked steak(s) , pigs drop cooked porkchop(s) , and chickens drop a cooked chicken(s) . This can be exploited by the player to not need to cook the meat. With a flint and steel, or a fire-enchanted weapon, all meat yielded will be cooked, and then eat the food there and then for its full potential. \n [ edit ] Spread \n \n \n \n  \nSafe building area around a fire \n \n \n Fire will spread over flammable surfaces, slowly causing all the blocks it can reach to burn away. Fire can climb up walls, across floors and ceilings, and over small gaps. More precisely, a fire (or still lava ) block can turn any air block that is adjacent to a flammable block into a fire block. This can happen at a distance of up to one block downwards, one block sideways (including diagonals), and four blocks upwards of the original fire source. Therefore if the player is using it as a fireplace, caution is needed. \n [ edit ] Extinguishing \n Fire will burn out after a while on its own, however the player may want to extinguish the fire as soon as possible to prevent damage. Punching or hitting the side of a burning block will extinguish the fire block \'attached\' on that side. Hitting fire with a tool does not use up any uses for the tool. Placing water , sand , or gravel on the fire will also extinguish it. A player on fire can jump into water to extinguish themselves or use a bucket of water as a portable fire extinguisher by dumping the water at their feet to put out the fire instantly. \n [ edit ] Eternal Fire \n Netherrack , a block found in the Nether , will burn forever when set on fire, unless put out by lava, water or the player. It can therefore be a useful trap or defense material around the player\'s shelter; though the player should be reminded that while this is quite effective at killing hostile mobs, it\'s also a potential danger to passive mobs, the player themselves, and any dropped items that fall in the fire will be lost. \n Lit Netherrack can be used as an alternative to torches. If the player is running low on coal , they can use Netherrack and flint and steel instead. Netherrack fire is brighter than a torch , and can be quickly extinguished. Note that rain won\'t put out Netherrack fire. \n Bedrock in the End will also burn eternally. \n If gamerule doFireTick is false, fire will last forever until it is put out by the player or rain. \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Indev \n \n \n January 9, 2010 \n Fire was added and was placed directly like a block. \n \n \n January 29, 2010 \n Ores can be smelted by using fire on dropped items . \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.2.6 \n Lava can cause surrounding flammable blocks to burn. Forest fires may start spontaneously if an above-ground lava pool is generated amongst trees during a biome\'s creation. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.2_02 \n Ability for blocks to burn forever was removed. Previously, a non- Netherrack flammable block, like wood , may burn continuously when its sides are surrounded by nonflammable blocks, like stone or dirt (the bottom is not necessary, though it is best not to have anything explicitly flammable underneath). A fire will only stay burning at the top of a flammable block, not on the sides or the bottom. Once the fire is burning, and has continued to do so for ten seconds or more without consuming the block beneath, one may remove all the adjacent blocks, and it will keep burning forever. If the block burns away, simply replace and reignite it, until it works. \n \nIt was also possible to make larger blocks of endless fire by putting flammable blocks diagonally adjacent to a block that is burning continuously. Since the already-burning block counts as nonflammable, it is already on fire, and the adjacent blocks may also burn continuously. By igniting multiple blocks this way, one could make a grid of diagonally-adjacent burning blocks. \n \n \n 1.6 \n Fire spreading was severely nerfed&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 infinite fire spread was disabled. [1] \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.2.1 \n 12w06a \n Hitting fire in creative now doesn\'t remove the block under the fire. \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w34a \n Fire spreads differently based on difficulty. \n \n \n 12w40a \n Firespread has been slightly nerfed again to prevent infinitely spreading fires. \n \n \n Pocket Edition Alpha \n \n \n 0.3.3 \n Removed fire, due to a spreading error. It was replaced by .name \n \n \n 0.7.0 \n .name was removed, though it still exists with ID 255 . Reimplemented fire with better spreading mechanics, though it does not burn infinitely on Netherrack , similarly on PC Versions. \n \n \n 0.7.1 \n Fixed a bug where fire would sometimes have all or parts of the texture black or white. Also, fire will now burn indefinitely on Netherrack . \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n It is possible for lightning to light a surface on fire during thunderstorms , but it will almost immediately be put out by rain. In rare cases in SMP , fire may not get extinguished. \n The texture for fire is not obtained from terrain.png ; instead, the fire animation is calculated by code and drawn into the "FIRE TEX" area of the in-memory copy of terrain.png . Water, lava, and portal textures work similarly. This is why texture packs with greater than 16x16 pixel tiles have glitches; the area drawn on is not scaled to fit the larger texture (no longer the case in 1.5 ). \n Though Wood Planks and logs are flammable, they burn up very quickly, making them nearly useless when making a fireplace, bonfire, etc. The only block that burns forever is Netherrack , along with Bedrock but only in The End . \n On very slow computers, when one sets a fire on the side of a block, logs off, and then logs back into the world, for a brief moment, they will see "FIRE TEX HNST!" instead of the fire animation. Notch confirmed that this was purposeful, and "FIRE TEX HNST!" was translated to "Fire texture, honest!" (no longer the case in 1.5 ). \n Entities , such as mobs or items, that are on fire do not emit any light. They also cannot set blocks around them on fire, even if they are flammable. \n Most players choose not to make fireplaces in wooden houses, due to the fact that fire can burn down wood quickly. \n The fire item is also used for an Undefined Item. This item can occur when a world with items of a mod is played without the mod. This item cannot be placed and will disappear when clicked on. \n If you sprint over fire, the sound will be as if you\'re walking on wood, also, if you obtain fire with commands, mods, or inventory editing and place it, the sound is also wooden placement. \n A Minecraft forest fire is much less dangerous than a real-life one. Burning trees in Minecraft can only create the usual one-meter fire blocks, as opposed to the multi-hundred-foot flames, convection winds, and flying embers that a powerful real-life wildfire can create. \n Passing through a Nether Portal while on fire will no longer show the fire, but you will technically still be on fire. \n Flaming Zombies will set you on fire if they hit you. \n Fire will be animated but not give off light when placed in an item frame. \n \n [ edit ] In Pocket Edition \n \n In 0.7.0, when fire was readded, parts of the texture were sometimes black or white. This was fixed in 0.7.1. \n Before 0.7.0, being on fire would put 2 transparent orange panels in front of the player\'s face. \n TNT is not set alight by fire, but rather burns away like normal blocks. \n Burning fire makes no sound. \n Skeletons and zombies burning in the daylight are different from zombies and skeletons that walked through fire or took a dip in lava. Where the ones that touched fire/lava are covered in flames, the ones burning in daylight constantly take damage and emit smoke. \n Early on, there was a glitch where if lava touched a flammable block, textureless fire would spread around the whole map, burning through everything. This was removed in 0.3.3, and had it\'s bugs fixed, and was reimplemented in 0.7.0.\n \n When Fire was removed, it was replaced with a stone-type block called .name .

The default player is popularly known as Steve and is confirmed on the \'Profile\' page near the section that allows you to change your skin, a name suggested by Notch as a joke, [1] and is intended to be a generic, genderless representation of a human being, [2] although the player\'s skin can be changed. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Appearance \n 2 Differences in other editions \n \n 2.1 Pocket Edition \n 2.2 Xbox 360 Edition \n \n \n 3 Health \n 4 Movement \n 5 Gameplay HUD \n 6 Experience \n 7 Modes \n 8 Customization \n 9 History \n 10 Trivia \n 11 See also \n 12 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Appearance \n The default player\'s skin (typically known as Steve) has dark brown hair, brownish skin, and indigo eyes, with a cyan-blue shirt (un-tucked on the left hand side and in the back), a pair of indigo jeans, and grayish-black shoes. Steve seems to have a slight stubble of a light brown beard. In the Xbox 360 edition the player\'s default skin can vary from Steve to seven other player skins (stated below). These skins now have names with the Xbox 1.7.3 update and are listed below. Multiple skin packs are available for purchase on the Xbox Live Marketplace. \n [ edit ] Differences in other editions \n [ edit ] Pocket Edition \n In the Pocket Edition , the player still makes the "oof" sound. In iOS versions of the Pocket Edition, Steve is named Stevie. In Android versions of the game, he is named Steve, as normal. A rare glitch in this edition allows a player clone to appear in multiplayer which mimics the player. \n [ edit ] Xbox 360 Edition \n In the Xbox 360 Edition , there are 8 defaulted versions of Steve for the player to use (as well as many packs of new skins featuring non-Steve characters from various video games, such as \'Splosion Man from his titular indie game and Master Chief from the Halo series).There are also skins featuring different mobs, such as skeletons, zombies, enderdragon, all those.The 8 default skins are Steve, Boxer Steve, Cyclist Steve,Tennis Steve, Scottish Steve, Prisoner Steve, Tuxedo Steve, and Athlete Steve. Some variants of Steve look nothing like him, while others are him with different clothes. \n [ edit ] Health \n \n Main articles: Health and Damage \n \n The player has 10 full hearts.1 full heart represents 2 health . When the player\'s hunger bar is at 9 points or higher, their health will slowly regenerate by half a heart every five seconds. The hunger bar depletes faster when the player does things like sprinting, jumping, attacking mobs, and mining, and it can be refilled by eating food . If the hunger bar is at 8 and a half points or lower, the player will not regenerate health unless in peaceful mode (or under the effect of certain potions ). If the hunger bar is down to 0, the player will start starving and losing health. On hard difficulty, starvation will kill you. On normal difficulty, it will bring you down to half of a heart. On easy difficulty, it will bring you down to 5 hearts. On peaceful difficulty the health bar will recover regardless of hunger but will still take starvation damage, and the hunger bar will not lose any points, even when under the effect of food poisoning. \n [ edit ] Movement \n \n Main article: Controls#Configurable controls \n \n \n Note: the numerical values used in this section are approximations based on experimentation. Slight variation from true values is possible, based on human error, and so each value also lists an error range. \n \n The player walks at a rate of 4.31(\xc2\xb10.2) blocks per second. This means that they can walk a total of 5172 blocks in one Minecraft day. \n \n Main article: Sprinting \n \n As of Beta 1.8, the player is able to sprint, [3] draining the food bar considerably (10\xc3\x97) faster than usual while doing so. [4] The player is capable of sprinting approximately 5.55(\xc2\xb10.02) blocks per second, as opposed to the regular pace of 4.31. The player can jump four blocks horizontally when sprinting. The player cannot sprint if there are only 3 bars or fewer left in the hunger meter. By default, sprinting is activated by double-tapping the forward key (default W ) then holding it. \n \n Main article: Sneaking \n \n Sneaking is a feature activated by holding the sneak key (default is \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift ). Sneaking prevents players from falling one or more blocks, making it highly useful for building horizontally outwards over empty space. However, if the sneak button is released while beyond the edge of a block, the player will fall down. Additionally, the player can still dismount blocks while sneaking by jumping over the block\'s edge. \n Note: In current versions of the game, if you are past the edge of the block and you stop sneaking, you will not fall off of that block, as it has been changed so that it will not put you past the block, but only at the very edge of that block. \n In Creative mode, the player flies at 10.88(\xc2\xb10.06) blocks per second. \n \n \n Movement Mode \n Speed (m/s) \n Speed (km/h) \n \n \n Walking \n 4.3 \n 15.5 \n \n \n Sprinting \n 5.6 \n 20.2 \n \n \n Sneaking \n 1.3 \n 4.7 \n \n \n Flying \n 10.8 \n 38.9 \n \n \n \n Main article: Jumping \n \n The maximum height a player can jump if without mods or the status effect "jump boost" is 1.249 blocks. \n [ edit ] Gameplay HUD \n The onscreen heads-up display (HUD) consists of the player\'s health bar, hunger bar , experience bar, and hotbar. The armor rating bar appears above the health bar if the player is wearing armor and the oxygen bar appears if the player is submerged in water . The HUD also contains the crosshair, and held object (or fist). The HUD can also be toggled by F1 . \n [ edit ] Experience \n \n Main article: Experience \n \n Experience points can be gained via experience orbs when killing mobs. The current level is indicated by a green number above the HUD, and the experience points can be used to enchant weapons, tools or armor with different useful attributes and skills (see enchanting table .) Anvils require experience to use. \n The level increases by obtaining enough experience points. All levels and experience are lost upon death, but can be partially restored by picking up the experience orbs at the place of death. [5] \n Experience is also obtained through activities such as mining, smelting (experience is only given when already-smelted items are taken out of the furnace), fishing, and animal breeding. \n [ edit ] Modes \n \n Main articles: Survival , Creative , Hardcore and Adventure \n \n \n In Survival mode, the player is able to place and destroy blocks, and use all tools available. The player has limited health (heart icons), hunger (drumstick icons), and oxygen (bubble icons) and it takes time to break blocks. \n In Creative mode, the player has the ability to fly by double tapping the Space key and to place infinite number of blocks, but with limited use of crafting and tools. The player cannot take damage (except from falling into the Void, or, with cheats enabled, typing the command "/kill"), has no hunger and has unlimited oxygen, and breaking blocks is instantaneous. \n In Hardcore mode, the player cannot respawn and the difficulty level is locked on hard mode. (If playing on a hardcore multiplayer server, the player is automatically banned from that server when they die.) \n In Adventure mode, there are no changes from Survival mode aside from being unable to break blocks without the correct tool. The gamemode can only be played by having cheats enabled and typing the command /gamemode 2 or /gamemode adventure , /gamemode a , or opening a multiplayer (including LAN) world. \n \n [ edit ] Customization \n \n Main article: Skin \n \n Users can change their character\'s skins; this can be done on the Preferences page of Minecraft.net by uploading a PNG image file, which will then replace the default skin. \n The Xbox 360 Edition has a separate default skin for each player. The ability to change that skin is currently now available using the Change Skin option in the game and Skin Packs 1 through 4 have been released. Skin packs that have now been removed from Xbox Live include the Summer of Arcade Skin Pack, the Halloween Charity Skin Pack, and the Festive Skin Pack. \n In the Pocket Edition , the player uses the default skin, and it can be changed by changing the char.png in the game\'s files or using external apps on both iOS and Android. \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n \n  \nThe armor bar as it appeared before the Adventure Update. \n \n \n Before Alpha 1.0.14 , the walking animation for the player was different; the player swung their arms wildly to their sides while walking as can be seen in the file archives , and in a video of Minecraft Classic from 2009 as well as in the video Zombie Town by Notch, which features the removed human mob. This animation is still used in Classic . \n After the Beta update, the default texture for the player was replaced with a beardless version. The bearded version is still obtainable by downloading the reference skin . The bearded version can often be mistaken for a smiley face. \n Before the Adventure Update , the armor bar had appeared in the position that the hunger bar is currently at now. \n The player can jump one block high, and two blocks long (in Classic , three blocks long). Since Beta 1.8 Pre-release 1 , the player can jump 4 blocks horizontally if sprinting. \n The player did not have an experience or hunger bar before Beta 1.8 pre1 . \n Before Minecraft RC2, when the player was damaged, he would make a deep "Ooh!" sound which represented the player\'s response when hurt. However, this sound suggested that the player was male, which was not consistent with/representative of female player skins, so Mojang changed the sound to make it more gender-neutral, and, as of RC2, any physical damage will play a flesh impact sound, and damage from falling would play sounds like bones breaking. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n The player\'s eye level (According to coordinates while pressing F3 ) is 1.62 meters. Since his eyes are 29 pixels above his feet, leaving 3 pixels above his eyes (.17m), Steve is approximately 1.79 meters tall (5\'10"). This seems to be confirmed by the game\'s code that shows Steve\'s hitbox being 1.8m tall and 0.6m wide. \n When hitboxes are toggled on (By pressing F3 and B ) the visible hitbox for the player actually starts at the player\'s neck and goes over the player\'s head as if it is the right size but standing on the player\'s shoulders. This does not appear to be the player\'s actual hitbox as skeletons can still shoot you in the feet. This may be a bug \n Zombies wear the same clothing as Steve. This has led to the discussion whether zombies are actually the dead bodies of past Steves. \n The player is right handed as they hold weapons, like swords, in their right hand. But they are left eye dominant, meaning they shoot left handed by holding the stock of a bow in their right hand. An easy way of seeing this is by charging a bow and pressing F5 . \n Steve is featured as a Micro Mob along with a creeper in the LEGO set 21102 LEGO Minecraft Micro World . \n The player seems to have peripheral vision. Lights and lit objects are more visible near the edges of the display (only with graphics set to "fast"). \n Steve is also an unlockable character in the Steam version of the game Super Meat Boy under the name "Mr. Minecraft". He has shorter jump height than other characters, and can mine squares from the level and place them as platforms. \n Steve\'s head is an unlockable helmet in the Xbox Arcade game, Hybrid . \n Steve\'s head is a wearable item in the game Borderlands 2 . \n Steve\'s head is able to be bought in the flash game "Fantasy Online", under the name "Minehead". \n Steve\'s terminal velocity is 162 km/h (100 mph), less than the average human\'s, about 190 km/h (120 mph). \n The Player appears to be very strong, being able to carry an entire inventory of gold blocks, which would weigh nearly 45,000 metric tons. However, it\'s possible the player\'s inventory goes to some kind of hyperspace ; after all, he doesn\'t look like he\'s carrying around a small mountain. \n Upon death, the player has the same death animation as any other mob, which is keeling over to the side and disappearing into a cloud of smoke (while viewed in third-person view or when the inventory is open). To other players, the player merely disappears. This was fixed in 1.6. \n The Player appears to be very experienced in jumping, as he can jump over 1 meter high (one block). \n Sometimes when you eat something, you can actually hear the player burp. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Steve (mob) \n Human \n Mobs \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n https://twitter.com/notch/status/6825860292157440 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n wordofnotch:28188312756 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n wordofnotch:7276719413 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n https://twitter.com/notch/status/108938691862470656 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/07/20/first-details-on-minecrafts-xp-system-notch-when-you-die-you-lose-all-levels-you-lose-all-xp \n \n \n \n \n Entities [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Entities/content \n \n \n \n \n Environment [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Environment/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Player&amp;oldid=504574 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Environment Entity  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t \xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9e \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 12 July 2013, at 14:02. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

They are found in most biomes , and are abundant in forest -related biomes. There are 4 different types of trees \xe2\x80\x93 oak trees, spruce trees, birch trees and jungle trees. All can grow in many shapes and sizes. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Structure \n 2 Growth and characteristics \n \n 2.1 Oak trees \n 2.2 Spruce trees \n 2.3 Birch trees \n 2.4 Jungle trees \n \n \n 3 Uses \n 4 Video \n 5 History \n 6 Bugs \n 7 Tips on cutting trees \n 8 Trivia \n 9 References \n 10 Gallery \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Structure \n \n \n \n  \nTrees can be generated anywhere where there is light and dirt. \n \n \n Their natural height varies widely, but most have a minimum height of 5 blocks (4 wood and 1 leaf), ranging up to 30 blocks for the "giant" Jungle trees. Trees can also be placed on top of each other by a Player , but dirt has to be placed for the sapling to grow. \n The tree canopy is composed of leaf blocks, and grows 1 block higher than the highest wood block (This does not apply to the giant oak tree, as the leaves grow 3 blocks higher). The canopy may begin from the ground, (for the shorter "bush trees" in the jungle) and go up to 6 blocks from the ground (for the tallest trees). Tree canopies appear to be generated from roughly spherical clusters of leaves about 5\xe2\x80\x937 blocks across, centered on sections of trunk or branches. Leaves must be supported by an adjacent trunk (or leaf blocks connected to the trunk), otherwise they will wither and disappear. \n Giant oak and giant jungle trees grow branches (wood blocks connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally to the trunk or other branches). Most of the time, a single tree will have between one and six branches, and each branch will have between one and six wood blocks. A few trees can have many more. Branches support a much larger canopy than a tree with a single trunk. Birch and spruce trees cannot grow branches. Jungle biomes has a special type: "bush trees" (one block of jungle wood completely covered by leaves). \n [ edit ] Growth and characteristics \n \n \n \n  \nA tree that was grown in a cave, with the necessary light provided by torches. Note that only a single torch by the sapling is required. \n \n \n Trees are grown from saplings , which have a 1/20 chance of dropping from leaf blocks when they are destroyed or decay. Some players harvest wood from high-efficiency tree farms . As of release 1.2 saplings now occur in four separate varieties: oak, birch, spruce, and jungle. \n \n \n \n  \nA tree that grew through a bridge \n \n \n The sapling must be planted on a dirt or grass block , and must have a light level of at least 8 in the sapling block. A sapling will uproot with light level 7 or less in the sapling block itself unless it has an unobstructed view of the sky (except by glass or other fully transparent materials). The sapling must also have at least 4 blocks of space above it; see the individual sections below for space requirements, as they vary between the different types of trees. If there is a ceiling above a sapling, this will limit the maximum height of the tree that can grow from that sapling. \n All trees in the active chunk radius around the player make attempts to grow at random intervals. For any given tree this can work out to about 3 attempts per minute, but a tree will usually not grow until nearly 30 minutes have elapsed since planting. When the tree attempts to grow it first checks that it has enough light, then chooses which type of tree to spawn. For oak trees, it will choose either small or large; for spruce trees, it will choose either short, tall, or very tall. Birch trees only have one type. \n \n \n \n  \nA small oak tree compared to a big oak tree. \n \n \n Now that the tree has passed a light check and chosen a size to attempt, it checks if there is space to grow into what it has already (randomly) chosen to become. If it encounters an obstruction during this check, it fails to grow and must wait for the next pass before it can attempt to grow again. This means that a tree in an open field with enough light will grow quite quickly (usually right around the 30 minute mark), but a tree in a tree farm that stunts its size may make several attempts before finally growing. \n If you are standing on a sapling when it turns into a tree you will be trapped inside and begin to suffocate . You can escape by moving or digging. Sometimes this death results in deletion of items. \n Bone meal forces the tree to grow if right clicked as long as all of the normal checks are in place (i.e., light, space, dirt, etc.). It does not guarantee a tree will grow, but forces it to attempt to grow, regardless of light level. The tree must still pass the space check for its randomly chosen type, before it grows. This is important to remember when limiting tree height, as the tree may attempt to grow a tall variant and fail even when all other requirements are met. \n Leaves of small oaks (but not large ones) will destroy fences , glass , paintings , stairs , pistons , torches , buttons , ladders and doors due to a mismatch between the tree\'s actual and test forms. While tree trunks will not grow through solid blocks, the branches of large oaks may grow through (replace) any blocks that are not directly above the trunk, including chests . Oak leaves are unique in being able to grow through leaves of other tree types. \n \n \n \n  \nPlanting trees in The Nether. \n \n \n All saplings will grow normally in The Nether and in The End , although they must be planted in dirt transported from the Overworld. Leaf blocks in the Nether have the same color as if they were placed in a desert biome. \n \n [ edit ] Oak trees \n Oak trees are unique in several ways compared to birch, spruce, and jungle trees. Oak trees have a much smaller space requirement, and while birch, spruce, and jungle trees can only grow through other leaves of their own type, oak trees will grow into any other leaf block. \n They come in four variants with widely different properties: \n \n Small oak trees are the most commonly encountered, and resemble birch trees in their shape and size. They require no horizontal clearance at the base, 1 block around the main trunk, 2 blocks from the top of the trunk up to the ceiling and 6-8 blocks of vertical clearance. Thus, a small oak tree can grow in a 1 deep hole, but not a 2 deep hole. Just as jungle trees, their growth will not be hindered by wood, leaves, dirt and saplings. \n \n \n \n \n  \nA large oak tree. \n \n \nLarge oak trees are more uncommon, and have a distinct look and different growth requirements. They often have "branches", outgrowths of wood on the sides of the trunk, or even freestanding and surrounded by leaves. They require 4-14 blocks of open space directly above the sapling to grow (Air or Leaves only) but can otherwise be completely enclosed on all sides.\n \n A large tree form exists with a single leaf block layer above the minimal 4-block trunk, allowing a tree to rarely grow in a vertical space with a height of only 5, but otherwise the maximum trunk height is 2 less than the vertical space, making the practical minimum height 6. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAn oak tree with vines. \n \n \nIn swamp biomes, naturally occurring oak trees tend to grow in the water. Unlike oak trees in other biomes, which typically have a slightly conical or pointed canopy, all swamp trees have round, flat topped canopies, and may have vines hanging down. If a sapling grows in a swamp biome, however, it won\'t include vines, and there is no way to grow a tree under water, giving players no way to naturally grow "swamp trees". Since they are composed of existing tree components, however, one can simply grow a normal tree and add the vines manually, and submerge them after the fact. Jungle trees, on the other hand, have vines both if they\'re naturally occurring, and if they\'re grown using four saplings (see below). \n As noted above, some biomes (prominently jungles) have "bush trees", with one block of wood completely covered by leaves. As with the swamp trees, their saplings will grow into normal oaks. \n \n \n [ edit ] Spruce trees \n \n \n \n  \nSeveral spruce trees in a taiga biome. \n \n \n Spruce trees, [1] [2] also known as pine trees, [3] grow from spruce saplings and have growth patterns and requirements very similar to birch trees, though they look very different. They are only found in the Taiga biome. Spruce wood has the same texture as oak wood, but it is a darker shade of brown, while its leaves are more dense, with a darker and more blue-ish tone to them. \n There are three different forms of these trees that may grow from any spruce saplings: \n \n A short variant with height similar to oak trees. [4] \n A tall, thin variant with leaves at the very top. [4] \n A "tall pine" variant, with a height limit of 17 rather than the usual 14. \n \n The leaves of the short variant tend to grow in discrete rows rather than the more "spherical" arrangement of oaks and birch trees, while the tall variants tend to have very few leaves, concentrated at the top. \n Like birch trees, they do not grow branches, and have a larger space requirement than oaks. This minimum space requirement is one block taller than the birch, at 5\xc3\x975\xc3\x978 blocks, and as with birch trees, they will not grow if any blocks occupy this volume. \n \n [ edit ] Birch trees \n \n \n \n  \nBirch trees since the Beta 1.2 \n \n \n Birch trees, the least common type of tree, look fairly similar to oak trees in terms of height, and with leaves of a paler color, however, they stand out with their unique, white bark. They are most commonly found in forest biomes. \n There is only a single type of birch tree: a straight trunk that never grows branches, like a small oak tree. The trunk will grow to be 5, 6, or 7 blocks tall. Birch trees always have leaves at least 2 blocks above the ground, whereas oak trees may be as low as 1 (at least when in forest biomes). See below for how their leaves grow. Because there is only one type, birch trees are the preferred type for automated tree farms. \n The smallest birch tree requires a 5*6 (diameter*height) volume of free space, whilst the tallest tree requires 5*8 volume. The volume starts at one meter above the base of the sapling, that is completely empty of anything but leaves of any type . The topmost 5*5 layer above the tree is always empty space. Birch trees will not grow if this space is obstructed by other blocks (including torches). This behavior is different from oak trees, which will grow regardless of obstructions (usually not growing into the obstructed area). Dark wood trees behave similarly (see below). \n Birch trees may grow faster than oak trees. A birch tree has been seen growing from sapling to fully grown tree in under 1 day. It looks like they skip the 30 minute delay entirely; in very rare cases they even grow within one minute. This has been reported for SSP and SMP. \n Birch trees yield a type of wood that can be made into unique white Wood Planks , and other trees yield planks of different shades of brown. \n Birch leaf distribution \n \n \n Top row \n \n \n \n          \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n \n \n \n 2nd row \n \n \n \n          \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n \n \n \n 3rd and 4th rows \n \n \n \n          \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n         \n \n \n \n Birch trees will always grow an absolute minimum of 50 leaves, which bodes well for the player considering the 1-in-20 chance for those leaves to drop saplings. If one is lucky, a birch tree may grow a maximum of 60 leaves. The leaf distributions are shown visually to the right, each table cell representing one \'slice\' of the tree viewed from above. The glass blocks represent a barrier, while the cyan flowers represent areas where leaves may grow, but do not always. The growth pattern, in detail, is as follows: \n \n The topmost row is one above the height of the tree, and always has exactly 5 leaves: one above the wood block and four orthogonally adjacent to it, forming a + shape.\n \n 5 leaves \n \n \n The second row is the top of the wood trunk, and also has 4 leaves adjacent to it. Diagonal to the wood block will be a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 additional leaf blocks.\n \n 5 - 7 leaves \n \n \n The third row has the wood in the middle, surrounded orthogonally and diagonally by leaf blocks. Those 8 leaf blocks are also surrounded orthogonally, for an additional 12 leaf blocks. One can think of this as a 5\xc3\x975 space where every block has leaves except the four corners. These corners are randomly filled with between 0 and 4 leaves, though having all four filled is very rare.\n \n 20 - 24 leaves \n \n \n The fourth row generates with the same rules as the third, and thus has a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 24 leaf blocks.\n \n 20 - 24 leaves \n \n \n The fifth and sixth (bottom) rows contain no leaves, only the wood block in the center. If the tree is 6 or 7 blocks tall, the additional 1 or 2 rows at the bottom will also be just a wood block.\n \n No leaves \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Jungle trees \n \n \n \n  \nJungle trees in a Jungle biome. \n \n \n Jungle trees are exclusive to the Jungle Biome and have a unique growth system. Jungle tree leaves drop jungle tree saplings, which appear tall and skinny like the jungle tree itself. When planted in grass or dirt they grow into a jungle tree with a 1x1 trunk, unlike the occasional jungle trees with a 2x2 trunk that you find naturally in the jungle biome. For these trees to grow, there must be no blocks adjacent to the sapling up to the height of the tree. \nIn order to grow a 2x2 jungle tree, four jungle saplings must be placed adjacent to each other. For growth to succeed, there may be no blocks adjacent (even diagonally) to the north-western sapling (which is considered the center of the tree) up to the final height of the tree, as well as no blocks 1 block away except at the same level of the sapling (even diagonally). Which sapling the Bone Meal is used on is irrelevant. Large jungle trees can grow up to 32 blocks high; trees as short as 10 blocks have also been observed. \nSome materials (including wood, leaves, dirt and saplings, but not vines, farmland, or tall grass) do not block the growth of jungle trees. \n \n \n \n \n  \nThis tree will not grow because of the red block. (Looking from the northwestern corner) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2x2 jungle trees will not grow within two spaces of the trunk of another 2x2 tree directly north and west direction of the existing tree. On the south and east directions it will not grow within 3 blocks. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAs of minecraft V 1.4.5 jungle trees will not grow within 2 blocks of an existing tree on the north and west side, and will not grow within 3 blocks of the south and east side. \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Uses \n Tree harvesting is an essential first step for any player in Survival mode. The wooden blocks can be harvested for wood , without requiring tools (although an axe quickens harvesting). Each wood block can be crafted into wooden planks and sticks , which are used for crafting tools . \n Wood can also be smelted into charcoal , an equivalent of coal . \n When leaves are harvested, or decay naturally, there is a chance they will drop a sapling , which can be planted to grow a new tree. Decaying oak tree leaves also have a 1/200 chance of dropping an Apple . Destroying leaves does not require a tool; a sword destroys leaves negligibly faster, but this quickly wears out the sword. Using a hoe to destroy a leaf block will not wear it out, but is the same speed as your hands. Since Beta 1.7, Shears have been added to harvest leaf blocks quickly, and will drop a usable leaf block for the player to pick up. One final method for destroying leaf blocks quickly is to set them alight with the Flint &amp; Steel , which spreads fire across the leaves and burns them all quickly. Trees with enough leaves can be used for homes, which will require 3 ladders, and a trapdoor to keep the mobs from getting in. \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n \n  \nA classic -styled tree before biomes were introduced. \n \n \n \n \n Classic \n \n \n 0.0.14a \n Added trees, they were only available as oak trees with a single foliage color. \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n ??? \n Added tree growth. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.2 \n Birch and pine trees introduced. Trees predating this update would appear to have multiple types of leaves, as the data indicating tree type was previously used for decay calculations. \n \n \n 1.5 \n Birch and pine saplings became available. Post-Beta 1.5 oak-type saplings will not stack with pre-Beta 1.5 saplings. \n \n \n 1.8 \n The Swampland biome was added, with a new tree design (made of the same blocks as oak trees), which are of more uniform size and have vines growing on them. There is no way to grow these trees; oak saplings will grow normal oak trees. A bush-shaped variety of oak tree was removed. \n \n \n 1.9pre4 \n Trees can sometimes be found growing on blocks of sand. This has been observed in swamp biomes. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.1 \n Oak leaves were given a 1/200(0.5%) chance of dropping a Apple when they are destroyed or decay. This is useful as now golden apples can be created without the player needing to find a dungeon. \n \n \n 1.2.1 \n The Jungle tree became available. A bug existed that transformed saplings in a 2\xc3\x972 square with jungle saplings into other jungle saplings if the growth of a giant tree fails. This would not be revealed until the block graphics were updated, such as when a block is placed or destroyed nearby. The bug was exploited to rapidly create jungle saplings from other saplings using bonemeal, since they do not drop as frequently. \n \n \n 1.2.4 \n Fixed sapling bug. Different tree logs have slightly different colors, and make different colored planks. ( e.g. , Birch tree logs are turned into a lighter plank texture when crafted into planks.) Neither blocks nor planks from different types of tree will stack with each other, but they can be freely mixed in crafting. Crafted items (notably sticks) no longer remember what sort of wood they came from. In particular, a smashed boat always produces oak planks (and some sticks). \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w18a \n Jungle trees were given a chance to drop cocoa beans from their leaves. \n \n \n 12w19a \n Jungle leaves no longer drop cocoa beans. Instead, small jungle trees can generate with the new Cocoa Plants already growing on them. \n \n \n 1.3.2 \n Large oak trees now generate with sideways logs . \n \n \n [ edit ] Bugs \n \n Trees can be rarely found with nothing underneath them. \n If you grow an oak or jungle tree (spruce and birch trees don\'t work.) above a dirt block, the tree will grow but the dirt block will stay between the logs. \n Trees can sometimes spawn on sand. \n When growing a giant jungle tree, some of the leaves furthest from the trunk will start to decay immediately after the tree appears. \n Sometimes, one side of a jungle tree will not generate. \n In 13w01b a little bit of bumping in and place with trees, if you look around you might see floating leaves or grass without trees or half a tree. Sometimes they are fully invisible and you have to quit the world and get back on to fix it. \n \n [ edit ] Tips on cutting trees \n \n When trying to cut a big tree (tall spruces, large oaks, jungle giants), the best technique is usually to get up to the top and cut the wood from there going down (the same applies to tall trees). Climbing to the top using a ladder is probably more efficient and safer than dirt "staircases", especially for very tall trees.\n \n Alternatively, you may choose to use the torch and sand method: Place a torch on the ground, then place a block of sand or gravel onto the torch. Place a block beside the torch, and then climb onto the one above the torch, and then jump while placing sand/gravel under yourself. Once you reach the top of the tree, you can cut it from the top as above. When you\'re back at the bottom, destroy the block suspended above the torch, the other blocks should fall on the torch and be converted into resources. \n \n \n It\'s worth clearing foliage and collecting the saplings and apples for later\xe2\x80\x94you may want to reforest some areas. Don\'t use a tool to bash leaves, as a block or bare hands will do just as well without wearing out your tools.\n \n If you\'ve got plenty of daylight and you\'ll be hanging around for a while, you can just chop the wood out and wait for the leaves to decay. If there\'s any question of time, bash or shear the leaves (or at least most of them) first. \n Shears do wear out, but will be much faster. The leaves won\'t drop saplings or apples when you shear them, but you get to take the leaf blocks home and break them at your leisure (or use them for something else). \n \n \n The largest jungle trees may look difficult, but there are several ways to handle them, and they offer up to two stacks of wood. Collect the saplings too, because you can carry them to other biomes and grow them with bone meal as above.\n \n Note that especially without shears or with stone axes, this is most of a Minecraft day\'s work. Plan ahead\xe2\x80\x94you may want to wait out the night 10 or 15 blocks up atop the trunk. Every so often, go back down to the ground to collect fallen wood and saplings\xe2\x80\x94if you try to leave them until you\'ve finished, some of the first logs and saplings will reach their 5-minute expiration. \n If you\'re using stone axes, bring a spare, as you will probably use up the first one. If you want to collect all the leaf blocks, bring an extra pair of shears. \n As above, top down is easiest, so get up there first.\n \n You may not even need ladders, if you can reach the top by climbing the vines, bashing/cutting through leaves, and perhaps using your axe to cut a footing at the top of the trunk. Note that unlike the ladders, you won\'t get vines back when you chop the wood blocks from under them. You can also use shears to harvest some vines from other sides of the tree, to fill in a complete path to the top. \n It is also possible to carve the tree into a spiral staircase. First cut the three lower blocks of one corner of the tree, then three blocks one block above ground of the neighboring column, the up one and harvest three at the third column, and so forth, going around the tree as you ascend. You should end up cutting your way up to the top of the tree - and from there you can then cut away the "staircase" as you descend again. As a bonus, if you run out of daylight while doing this, you should be quite safe atop the tree. \n If you do need ladders, but haven\'t got them, you can take a block or few of wood in a column (that is, a groove up the trunk), use those to make some ladders, and run the ladders up the groove, making more ladders as needed and as you mine the tree. (You might need to make a Crafting Table with the first block.) \n \n \n When you reach the top, you will find that the trunk has one block reaching above the other four. Chop that one to start the canopy decaying. If you\'re willing to spend extra time or an extra pair of shears, you can be methodical about clearing all leaves above your foot level. Otherwise, just clear away layers of leaves so that the drops (wood, leaves, saplings) will fall down to the ground. Clear leaves away from the trunk to speed decay, and clear through bushy sections to expose and chop the branches. As you open up the canopy and clear branches, work your way down the trunk. Try to gather drops as you go, and at least once go back down to gather drops from ground level. \n Once past the branches, you\'ll be standing on a fairly high 2\xc3\x972 pillar of wood. Go collect drops from the ground again. This is often a good time to take a break, as you wait for the last leaves to decay, fetch another axe, go home to sleep, or wait out the night atop the tree. Then you can easily collect the rest of your wood. \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Trees will only grow if they are planted on a chunk of the map that is loaded into memory. If you plant saplings and then explore another more distant area of your world for a few Minecraft days, they will still be saplings when you return. \n It seems with the addition of different types of lakes above ground, you may have floating trees. This happens since the tree is spawned when the chunk loads first. Then, the lake is spawned afterward. This leaves the tree floating above the lake. \n If a sapling is surrounded by a 2 block tall tube it guarantees that it will, eventually, grow into a big tree. The tube forces the small tree growth to always fail each attempt. However, this takes far longer to produce a mature tree, due to the low chance that a sapling will try to grow into a big tree. \n Trees can grow to encase the player in leaves. This may allow them to see through the world. \n Two regular saplings planted near each other have a chance to grow above their normal height limit of 14. (Example: 16 tall with 57 wood) [ citation&#160;needed ] \n A tree standing over a lava pool may catch fire from the lava. These fires can be very dangerous, burning down entire forests. Though an effective way to prevent this is to avoid trees that are near lava, or cover the lava, and so on to prevent the forests from burning down. \n Trees can naturally spawn on stone, sand, and clay. [ citation&#160;needed ] It is unknown if this is a bug. \n Large jungle trees have dirt generated under them if they spawn with part over air or leaves. \n Oak trees drop red apples on occasion, so naming them oak trees is botanically incorrect. \n On rare occasions, jungle trees can sometimes exceed cloud level.

When the player creates a new world the sun starts on the eastern horizon at dawn. As time passes, it will slowly move westward across the sky and over the western horizon while the moon rises on the eastern horizon. Daytime lasts 10 minutes (in real time). Grass blocks will spread most quickly when exposed to sunlight, which is at the high-point of the day, at about time 4300. The deeper underground the player is, the less sunlight will illuminate the ground, and ultimately there will be no sunlight at all. A gap or a vertical shaft in the ceiling of a cavern will allow sunlight to filter in. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Sunlight \n 2 Hostile Mobs \n 3 History \n 4 Gallery \n 5 Trivia \n 6 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Sunlight \n Sunlight, in game, is the name given to the light which illuminates all blocks which do not have a shadow cast over them by a non-transparent block positioned vertically above them in the sky , or if it\'s raining . Clouds do not cast shadows, and shadows are not affected by the position of the sun in the sky. As of Beta 1.5, however, clouds in weather like rain or snow have been darker, and the light coming from the sunlight is not as bright. During these storms the ambient light value during the day will be reduced to 12 from the usual 15, and in thunderstorms the light level will be reduced to 7, allowing hostile mobs to spawn . \n Sunlight (or torchlight ) can be used to turn dirt blocks into grass blocks , as long as there is an illuminated grass block adjacent to the dirt. \n [ edit ] Hostile Mobs \n Hostile mobs will not spawn in sunlight, although existing mobs are affected in different ways by the light. Skeletons and Zombies will be set on fire upon entering an area illuminated by sunlight; however, the mobs will try to avoid contact, and will not burn if the mob is in water or in rain. Spiders turn neutral while in direct sunlight, until attacked by the player. Endermen will teleport away from players in sunlight. All other hostile mobs, such as Creepers , Slimes , and Silverfish are completely unaffected by sunlight. \n Certain Nether mobs will burn, but otherwise all are also unaffected due to their immunity to fire. Some Nether mobs such as zombie pigmen and magma cubes can spawn in all light conditions. In addition, boss mobs do not take damage from sunlight. \n [ edit ] History \n According to Notch, the Minecraft sun actually used to rise in the north, not in the east. [1] This was a bug, but was left in the game. [2] This was changed in Minecraft Beta 1.9 prerelease 4, so the sun and moon now both rise in the east. [3] \n In the 1.9 pre-release 4, both the sun and the moon were changed from being square to having a more rounded look to them. [4] However, since 1.9 pre-release 6 they are square-shaped again, although it is unknown whether they will be back to being exactly like they were or will somehow be modified. Notch said in a Twitter post that it was for \'consistency\' purposes. \n The Sun and Moon graphics used to be in /terrain in the minecraft.jar. Since the 1.9 pre-release, /terrain isn\'t used anymore and now the Sun and Moon graphics are in /environment. \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Example of the sun rising in the horizon. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Example sunset seen from the top of a Jungle tree . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Example of sunset with a "round" sun in Beta 1.9 pre-release 5. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The sun viewed from high up, making it seem like the player is in space \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n When the sun rises and sets, the blocks change their light level depending on what angle the sun is at (giving the effect of gradually getting lighter at dawn and gradually getting darker at dusk). \n You can\'t see the Sun or Moon with a render distance set to Short or Tiny. \n The sun is larger during sunrise and sunset. \n The position of the sun in the sky does not affect lighting and shadows, so a device such as a sundial would be impossible. \n You can\'t see the sun on the Pocket Edition . \n In Creative Mode , it is possible to reach very high y-values using the flying feature. At a y-value of about 576, the moon will appear opposite the sun, or, at night, the sun becomes visible opposite the moon, making it seem almost as if the player is in space. \n If the player is underwater and looks at the sun, it looks the same as the sun at sunset. \n When at about the waterline UNDER water, go to third person. The sun is blocked out and the game goes to render distance tiny, except the "fog" is blue. \n The player doesn\'t go blind when looking directly at the sun. \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n notchtweet:88155424880201728 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n notchtweet:115331778968944640 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n notchtweet:124414532847284224 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n notchtweet:124398932376817664 \n \n \n \n Environment [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Environment/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Sun&amp;oldid=502513 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Category : Environment  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 7 July 2013, at 13:48. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

At the top right is a forest. \n \n \n Biomes are regions in a Minecraft world with varying geographical features, flora, heights , temperatures, humidity ratings, sky colours and foliage colours. Introduced in the Halloween Update, biomes separate every generated world into different environments, paralleling the real world; examples of biomes include the forest, jungle, desert and tundra. Prior to the Halloween Update, every world had only a single theme, either grassy or snowy. \n In the Anvil file format , biomes are stored directly in the world data. This differs from the previous Region file format format, where biomes were dynamically calculated from the seed. \n The term biome is analogous to its scientific usage: on Earth, a biome is climatically and geographically defined by distinctive communities of plants, animals and soil organisms supported by similar climatic conditions. They are often referred to as ecosystems. [1] [2] \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Biome types \n 2 Technical biomes \n \n 2.1 Biome numbers \n \n \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n \n 4.1 Biome history \n 4.2 Anvil file format \n \n \n 5 Issues \n 6 Gallery \n 7 References \n 8 See also \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Biome types \n There are 12 main biome types and a number of technical biomes . Main biomes can be distinguished by the grass and leaf colors in the biome, along with the types of blocks present (e.g. types of trees or other plants like cacti , sand coverage in deserts). Biomes are pseudo-randomly generated using the map seed . Technical biomes provide smoother transitions between main biome types, or introduce extra custom features within a main biome, such as rivers, beaches, hills and border areas. \n \n \n Name and Features \n Description and Sample Image \n \n \n Forest \n Oak and Birch Trees , Flowers , Wolves , Mushrooms \n \n A biome with a lot of trees, occasional hills and a fair amount of grass . Oak and birch trees grow in this biome. Mushrooms , tall grass, roses and flowers can occasionally be found. Forests can occasionally be generated as a technical biome in plains biomes. This is one of the best biomes to start out in, due to the abundance of wood. The frequency of trees makes it dangerous to navigate at night, due to obscured vision, and ease of mobs to spawn. Forest biomes are also one of the smallest biomes.\n  \n \n \n \n Desert \n Sand , Cacti , Dead Bushes , Sandstone , Sugar Cane , Desert wells , Desert Temple , NPC Villages \n \n A barren biome consisting mostly of sand , large dunes, dead bushes and cacti . Sandstone is commonly found underneath the sand. Rain never falls in this biome. Sugar Cane can be found if the desert is next to an ocean or river biome. The lack of visual obstruction makes mobs highly visible at night. Desert NPC Villages , desert wells and desert temples are found exclusively in this biome. Lakes do not generate in this biome since 1.6, although lava lakes still can.\n  \n \n \n \n Plains \n Tall Grass , Grass , Flowers , NPC Villages , Horses \n \n A relatively flat biome with rolling hills and much tall grass but with few trees. Gullies, water holes, and NPC Villages are common. Passive mobs spawn often in plains biomes. Cave openings and water or lava springs are easily identifiable due to its unobstructed terrain. As of 13w16a, it is also the only biome where horses spawn naturally.\n  \n \n \n \n Swampland \n Witch Huts , Oak Trees , Grass , Vines , Lily Pads , Clay , Mushrooms , Slimes , \n \n  A biome characterized by a mix of flat, dry areas (including lots of small islands) around the sea level and shallow pools of water with floating lily pads . Clay , sand and dirt are commonly found at the bottom of these pools. Trees are often covered with vines and can be found growing out from the water . Mushrooms spawn abundantly in this biome. Stalks of sugar cane can be found along the shores. The colors of the water , grass , leaves and vines are much darker than in other biomes. As of 1.4, witch huts spawn in swamps. Slimes will also spawn naturally during the night.\n  \n \n \n \n Jungle \n Jungle Trees , Jungle Temples , Ferns , Flowers , Vines , Ocelots , Cocoa Pods , Chickens \n \n A very dense, tropical biome. It features large jungle trees that can reach up to 31 blocks tall with 2\xc3\x972 trunks. Oak trees are also common. The landscape is lush green and quite hilly, with many small lakes of water often nestled into deep valleys, sometimes above sea level. Leaves cover much of the forest floor\xe2\x80\x94these "bush trees" have single-blocks of jungle wood for trunks, surrounded by oak leaves for foliage. When inside a jungle, the sky will become noticeably lighter. This is the only biome containing ferns and the aforementioned jungle trees. Vines are found alongside most blocks and may be found close to the surface in caves . Ocelots , Jungle Temples and Cocoa Plants spawn exclusively in this biome, the latter found on jungle trees. Warning: If you have a slow computer or OS is 90% full or more, venturing into a jungle may crash Minecraft, or worse, your computer.\n  \n \n \n \n Ice Plains (Tundra)\n Snow , Snowfall , Oak Trees , Ice \n \n An expansive, flat biome with a huge amount of snow . It does not rain in this biome\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x89it snows instead. Lakes and rivers are frozen over. Hills tend to be more mountainous. Sugar Cane will spawn in this biome, but tend to become uprooted when chunks load as the water sources freeze to ice . There are very few natural oak trees in this biome. Due to their size and the scarcity of wood , initial survival becomes difficult in comparison to other biomes. No above ground structures spawn here.\n  \n \n \n \n Taiga \n Snow , Snowfall , Ice , Spruce Trees , Flowers , Wolves \n \n A hilly biome densely filled with spruce trees. Grass is a dull gray-blue. Snowfall occurs in this biome, forming snow and ice. Hills are common, and wolves are found in this biome.\n . \n \n \n \n Extreme Hills \n Oak Trees , Flowers , Emerald Ore , Monster Egg \n \n A highly mountainous biome (with some mountains reaching y=124) with dull gray-blue grass and a few scattered oak trees. Cliffs, peaks, valleys, waterfalls, overhangs, floating islands, and many other structures exist, offering outstanding views. More underground cave systems are present here than in any other biome. Falling is a significant risk, as there are many ledges and sudden drops large enough to cause severe fall damage or even death. Extreme Hills and Extreme Hills Edge are the only biomes where Emerald Ores spawn. They are also the only true biome in which silverfish can be found naturally.\n  \n \n \n \n Ocean \n Water , Sand , Clay , Dirt , Squid \n \n An extremely large, open biome made entirely of water , with underwater relief on the sea floor, such as small mountains and plains, usually including dirt , sand , and clay . There is no maximum limit to the size of oceans. [3] Oceans typically extend under 25,000 blocks in any direction, reaching out to 100,000 in rare circumstances. Small islands with infrequent vegetation can be found in oceans. Friendly mobs do not spawn on these islands, but hostiles do. Epic caves are very common below sea level, and entrances to underground ravines can be found at the bottom of the ocean, as well as abandoned mine shafts . Oceans can also be generated as technical biomes, appearing as deep ponds on beaches. In the Xbox 360 version, they usually also surround the edges of the map.\n  \n \n \n \n Mushroom Island \n Mushrooms , Huge Mushrooms , Mycelium , Mooshrooms \n \n This rare biome consists of a mixture of flat landscape and steep hills and has mycelium instead of grass as its common surface block . However, if you do place down a Grass Block , it is a very bright green color compared to other biomes. It is always adjacent to an Ocean and it is often found isolated from other biomes. It is the only biome where huge mushrooms can spawn naturally, and where mushrooms can grow in full sunlight.\n No mobs other than Mooshrooms spawn "naturally" in this biome, including the usual night-time monster spawns. This also applies to caves, abandoned mine shafts, etc. below mushroom biomes, meaning exploring underground is relatively safe. This includes player-made structures as well. \n However, Monster Spawners will still spawn mobs, the player can still breed animals (brought in from other biomes), golems can still be built, and Spawn Eggs work as usual. \n This biome is commonly found in the middle of ocean biomes, however, it can be found rarely attached to the mainland. \n Trees can be grown from saplings in this biome, as well as other dirt or grass-based plants, as long as they are not directly adjacent to mycelium, which will take over the dirt square from the plant and uproot it. Mycelium cannot be tilled directly, but it can be dug away and replaced as dirt, then immediately tilled. Once created, farmland can resist takeover by mycelium. \n \n \n \n \n Hell (The Nether )\n Magma Cubes , Netherrack , Glowstone , Soul Sand , Nether Brick , Gravel , Quartz , Ghasts , Blazes , Zombie Pigmen , Nether Fortress , Wither Skeletons \n \n  This is the biome used to generate the Nether . Most of the terrain is composed entirely of expansive netherrack mountains, caves, and walls at all altitudes, though also spawns Nether Quartz . Unlike other biomes it is enclosed by bedrock at layers 128 and 1. Lava oceans cover this biome at layer 31, while lava springs flow down from the bedrock ceiling (and occasionally from walls), making lava streams and lakes very common. Besides generating more often, lava also flows further and faster than it does in the Overworld. It is the only biome where ghasts , blazes , wither skeletons and magma cubes naturally spawn. Glowstone is also found beneath netherrack ceilings and outcrops, while gravel and soul sand appear in layers and outcrops. Many of the creatures and resources of the Nether can only appear in Nether fortresses (the dark structure in the picture).\n  \n \n \n \n Sky ( The End )\n End Stone , Endermen , Obsidian , Ender Crystals , Ender Dragon \n \n  This biome is used to generate the End . Unlike other biomes it is composed almost entirely of a finite, floating landmass of End Stone , with the exception of obsidian towers and Ender Crystals . Only Endermen and a sole Ender Dragon can spawn in this biome. Using this biome in the Overworld (using external editors or superflat codes) will cause the sky to turn black.\n  \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Technical biomes \n Technical biomes are found alongside or within their larger counterparts. They are not considered true biomes but they are referred to as biomes in the code and the debug menu. However, these technical biomes serve an important role in the Minecraft world in creating more realistic terrain. \n There are seven known technical biomes, although there are less-technical biomes. \n \n \n Name \n Description and Sample Image \n \n \n River \n A biome that consists of water blocks that form in an elongated, curving shape similar to a real river. Rivers cut through terrain or separate the main biomes. They attempt to join up with ocean on the other side, but will sometimes loop around to the same area of ocean. They have no current. Rivers are also a reliable source of clay . These biomes are good for fishing.\n  \n \n \n \n Frozen River \n This variant of the river only spawns in tundra biomes. The surface layer of water is frozen .\n  \n \n \n \n Beach \n Generated on the shores of oceans, beaches are composed of sand. Beaches penetrate the landscape, removing the original blocks and placing in sand blocks. These are also useful for fishing. Beaches are usually a lot bigger in a Taiga biome.For the history of beaches, see the Beach page.\n  \n \n \n \n Mushroom Island Shore \n Mushroom shores represent the flat shore area of the mushroom biome.\n  \n \n \n \n Frozen Ocean \n Found near snowy biomes, frozen oceans contain ice on the top layer of water.\n  \n \n \n \n Extreme Hills Edge \n Acts as a fringe between mountains and most other biomes.\n  \n \n \n \n Hills \n Hills are generated within Forest, Taiga, Desert, Jungle, and Tundra biomes and are referred in the F3 menu as "ForestHills", "TaigaHills", etc. Forest hills seem to be generated more rarely than the other hills in their respective main biome. Tundra Hills are usually taller, with height comparable to Extreme Hills biomes. In update 1.3 hills generated in forest and desert biomes are now taller.\n   \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Biome numbers \n \n Main article: Data values#Biome IDs \n \n Each type of biome, including technical biomes, has its own biome number , shown in the following table.

" To the right of the player is a taiga, to the left is either a forest, or woods, I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember. In the distance is probably tundra. " ~ Notch \n \n \n Notch, when he was the lead developer of Minecraft, wanted to add biomes, but he couldn\'t for a long time. He says the intersection points looked terrible and so, biomes weren\'t added in the Seecret Updates . [ citation&#160;needed ] \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.2 \n Added biomes. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.8 \n Biomes got an overhaul, removing some biomes, such as the tundra and the taiga, and others replaced with nine fractal-based biomes that were a mix of the previous biomes and new biomes. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0 \n Re-added tundra and added Mushroom Islands. \n \n \n 1.1 \n Re-added snow in taigas, added hills and beaches. \n \n \n 1.2 \n Added Jungle biome. \n \n \n 1.3 \n Hills in forests and deserts are taller. \n \n \n 1.6 \n 13w17a \n Water lakes no longer spawn in deserts. \n \n \n [ edit ] Anvil file format \n The Anvil file format allows for biomes to be stored in the world data. In contrast, the Region file format relies on the seed to dynamically calculate biome placement. This would cause biome placement in older worlds to change when the biome generation code was changed. With the current Anvil format, the biome data is stored along with the rest of the world data, meaning it will not change after the world is generated and can be edited by third-party map-editing tools. Furthermore, "edge" biomes allow for biomes to continue extend beyond the edge chunks of an old world. This allows for smooth transitions in world generation after the generation code changes in an update. \n [ edit ] Issues \n Issues relating to "Biome" are maintained on Mojira.

From this screen a player can equip armor , craft items on a 2x2 grid, and equip tools , blocks and items . Also displayed here is the player\'s Minecraft skin. \n The inventory is opened by pressing the E key. This key can be changed from the in-game options menu. The inventory can also be closed with the Esc key. \n The inventory consists of 4 armor slots, 27 storage slots, and 9 hotkey slots. Items in the hotkey slots can be selected during play using the keyboard (keys 1-9 ) or mousewheel, and placed or wielded with the mouse buttons. \n Most items can stack up to a maximum of 64 in one slot. Tools (with the exception of clocks and compasses ) cannot be stacked. Certain items, such as Snowballs , Buckets , Eggs , Signs and Ender Pearls are special and can only stack up to 16. \n To split a stack, right click the stack. If the stack is an odd quantity, then it will leave the smaller part (for example, when right-clicking 7 items in one slot, then you will grab 4 items and leave 3 items). This leaves half the stack on the square and allows you to move the other half. Conversely, while holding a stack in the inventory, right click can be used to place just one item anywhere on the inventory grid. Also, one way to organize and craft items is by holding \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift and clicking on the item. By doing so while a chest is open, the item stack will immediately go into the chest that you have open. And if you \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift click on an item in the chest, the stack will enter your inventory. If you do this with only your inventory open and the item is on your hotbar, \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift click will move the item stack into your above inventory. Doing so to an item in your inventory will move it to your hot bar . Double click items to fill the stack up as much as possible. Drag item stacks around to divide them up over the dragged-over slots. To move all items of one kind into a chest from your inventory (and vice versa), pick up any item, hold \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift , and double click one of the items (or a stack) of the items you want to move. \n Drag item stacks around with the right mouse button to place one of that stack in each dragged-over slot, if that slot is not occupied already. Pressing the \'drop\' key (default Q ) while the mouse is over an item in the inventory or a container will drop it. Held armor can be equipped by right-clicking. \n Items can be dropped into the world by clicking outside the inventory window while holding items, or by closing the inventory with items either held or placed in the 2x2 crafting grid. Items dropped in the game world will disappear after 5 minutes if not collected, but items placed using the right mouse button will not. Chests can be used to extend your inventory space, but they must be placed in the game world before they can be used. \n Armor is only considered equipped when it is in an armor slot; when in any of the regular inventory slots, it is not considered "worn" and does not offer protection. \n Inventory is saved on multiplayer servers, so that players\' personal inventory, chests, etc. are saved when you leave, allowing the players to continue where they left off. \n Items have tooltips displaying their name if the cursor is hovered over the item. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Creative mode \n 2 Being attacked \n 3 External inventories \n 4 History \n 5 Bugs \n 6 Trivia \n 7 See also \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Creative mode \n \n \n \n  \nCreative mode item selection screen (opened to the search tab) \n \n \n In Creative mode , the inventory contains all blocks and items from Survival, along with some others that can\'t be found like Sponges . The player can pick up blocks from here to use endlessly or drop things right in the menu to remove them. \n Clicking on something more than once will give them a stack of that block or item. Right-clicking a block or item will give the player a full stack. \n The Creative inventory screen is sorted into 10 sections: \'Building Blocks\', \'Decoration Blocks\', \'Redstone\', \'Transportation\', \'Miscellaneous\', \'Foodstuffs\', \'Tools\', \'Combat\', \'Brewing\' and \'Materials\'.

[1] \n \n In Indev, you could walk around while having the inventory open. \n As of the Seecret Friday Update 9 , inventory is now saved on multiplayer servers \n In Alpha, the player could place items in the 2x2 crafting grid and they would stay there when the inventory was closed, but this has been removed as of the Beta release: items placed in the crafting grid are now dropped simultaneously when the inventory is closed. \n As of Alpha 1.1.0 , inventory is saved on multiplayer servers, so that players\' personal inventory, chests, etc. are saved when you leave, allowing the players to continue where they left off. \n As of the Beta 1.0 release, items now have tooltips displaying their name if the cursor is hovered over the item. \n The default key for opening and closing the inventory was I in Beta 1.3_01 and older, but was changed to E in Beta 1.4 because Notch found it to be much more efficient. [2] \n Since Beta 1.8, the inventory became an Item selection page in Creative Mode with all items and without the character, similar to one in the Classic 0.30 Creative Mode. In Creative mode, picking up a block with a full hotbar puts it in an inventory like the one in Survival mode. The only way to see the inventory was to open a chest, furnace, dispenser, crafting bench, brewing stand, minecart with a furnace/chest, or enchanting table. \n In the Beta 1.9 Prerelease 4, the gray frame surrounding the hotkey items becomes white and the semi-transparent black background becomes completely transparent when the player holds a Golden Apple or an Enchanted Item . This also happens when you look at a Primed TNT , a Painting or an Enderman . This was fixed in Beta 1.9 Prerelease 5. \n As of the 1.2.4 update, the body parts drawings have been reintroduced in the armor pieces. \n As of snapshot 12w21b the inventory screen in Creative mode is tabbed when previously it was one big screen full of blocks with terrain blocks at the top and items further down. The Creative inventory menu is now organized into 10 categories: Building blocks, Decoration blocks, Redstone, Transportation, Miscellaneous, Foodstuffs, Tools, Combat, Brewing, and Materials. The Survival-mode inventory is also accessible. The inventory button does not close the inventory and instead opens search tab, so the player has to press Esc instead. \n In snapshot 12w22a , the orientation of tools/weapons/items were changed from being oriented towards the left to being oriented towards the right. The player can wear or remove armor in creative mode; before, the player could not remove armor that was already worn, or put on armor. The Search tab does not automatically open up unless the player presses their chat key, allowing the inventory to be closed with the normal inventory key again. \n \n [ edit ] Bugs \n \n If you open your inventory while sitting in a vehicle and wearing Leggings , you will see that your legs will be bent in a sitting position but your Leggings will not. They will remain upright and come off your body right through your legs. The reverse happens if you put on Leggings while in a vehicle and leave it. \n If you are flying while in Creative Mode in the inventory, if you click something, it grabs the maximum stack possible and, if you try to put it in the inventory again, it will not place it. This occurs because the Shift key is stuck (press both shift keys to unstick it) \n If the player has the inventory screen open when he/she dies, the Health and death screen does not appear until the inventory screen is closed. The player goes through the death animation and falls over, turning red, but does not "disappear" or die completely (the player continues to follow the mouse cursor as it is lying on the side) until the inventory screen is closed, upon which the screen immediately switches to the death screen. \n If you are moving an item when you die, you will not lose it. \n If you are in third person mode and position yourself so you can see your head with the inventory screen open, you will see your head spin and move in a extremely fast and random manner. \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n \n \n  \nDeath while you are in your inventory \n \n \n \n If you are in your inventory when you die, your character will fall over and have a red tinge. \n If you are falling asleep in a bed and you access your inventory screen, your character will be laying down. However, the current skin you have on will stay the same. A similar effect is seen with riding a boat, pig, or minecart, but your character will be sitting. \n In the Item Selection screen, the Sponge block is available again, but it does not absorb water . \n In the Item Selection screen, some items and blocks are missing, such as huge mushroom blocks , dragon eggs and mob spawners . \n Your character will always look at your mouse cursor while in inventory. \n The "Search Items" tab\'s compass icon acts just like any other, and spins wildly in the Nether and End dimensions. \n The maximum number of items the inventory can hold (36 stacks of 64 items each) is 2304. \n If you hold shift, while holding an item on your cursor, you can quickly click around your inventory, or crafting table, etc. and divide it quicker. For instance, if you hold a stack of 64 dirt, and you use this technique, it will divide into 2 stacks of 32 if you click twice, 3 stacks of 21 clicking 3 times, 4 stacks of 16 for 4 times, and so on. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Crafting \n Smelting \n Item Repair \n Items \n Item Durability \n Blocks \n Entities \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpmK7rDU5bA \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n notchtweet:50500645144375296 \n \n \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Inventory&amp;oldid=501771 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Gameplay UI  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 5 July 2013, at 23:26. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

Don\'t try to set up a server unless you have some basic computer and networking abilities. Your best bet is to look on the internet for a guide on how to set up a server. \n Hosting and playing on the same machine does not usually matter, unless you have a slow computer. \n Netbooks and Notebooks don\'t usually make for good server machines. They typically have lower-end hardware in comparison to desktops and dedicated server machines. \n Hosting a server with many players in a wireless network (WLAN and especially WWAN) is not recommended. Use a wired network instead, such as Ethernet. \n If you decide you don\'t want to host, but still want to play online, check out the public server options in the Minecraft servers area of the Minecraft forum. \n If you still want to manage a server, but not from home, check out the Minecraft server hosting area of the Minecraft forum or other websites. Expect to pay monthly for this type of server since finding free hosting is a rarity. \n \n [ edit ] Server requirements \n Please see server requirement comparison tables for more information on server requirements. \n [ edit ] Playing on a server \n For information on playing on a server, including joining a server and tips and tricks, read the Playing on servers tutorial . \n [ edit ] Server commands \n The server commands page has a list of useful commands. \n [ edit ] Types of servers \n Multiple archetypes of Minecraft servers exist, distinguished by the unique gameplay features, rules, and societal structures which they implement. No two servers are the same, and frequently the line between archetypes is blurred or indistinguishable. Many special types of servers rely on the use of map editors or the creative game mode to build custom maps and the Craftbukkit server software to provide proprietary features. \n [ edit ] The Big Three \n These types of servers are the most popular choice for creation and achieve the most players. \n [ edit ] FactionPvP \n This type of server is modified with proprietary software to allow players to form groups called factions and claim &amp; protect land from other factions. Usually this is accomplished with the Craftbukkit server software and the Factions plugin or the Towny plugin . Land protected by a faction cannot be built on or destroyed by players belonging to a different faction. factions can also ally with each other or declare war on each other. The amount of land one faction can protect at any given time is decided by the number of players belonging to that faction. The FactionPvP servers usually allow griefing and are very flexible with customization. \n [ edit ] PvP/ Survival \n This type of server typically falls either into the Adventure or Survival categories, with the exception that Player-versus-Player (PvP) combat is allowed or encouraged in tandem with Player-versus-Environment (PvE) combat. Griefing is usually not allowed unless stated otherwise. \n [ edit ] Economy \n This type of server is modified to introduce a currency system, usually in an intangible form. Players trade in this currency to obtain resources, or hoard it in an attempt to be the wealthiest person on the server. This can be included on several other servers. \n [ edit ] Less Popular \n Just because the titles states they are less-popular doesn\'t necessarily mean they are. These servers take more than just a few hours to create and can become the greatest. \n [ edit ] Creative \n This type of server is played entirely in the creative game mode, with building being the focus of the community. Rarely are these servers unmodified due to the ease with which griefing is accomplished; most of these servers use proprietary protection systems to prevent players\' constructions from being modified without their consent. \n [ edit ] Adventure \n This type of server usually prevents most or all attempts to build or destroy blocks. Instead of traditional gameplay, these servers offer unique gameplay elements, often inspired by Role-Playing Games. These servers are rarely unmodified, often bearing significant changes via server modifications which make normal gameplay impossible. \n [ edit ] Survival \n The most popular current server type, Survival servers are typically played entirely in the Survival game mode. Maps on these servers usually consist of a premade spawn location, which is sometimes built by the server operators using creative mode, and a surrounding area created by players. These types of servers are frequently modified to suit the desires of the operators, and frequently have some kind of system which allows players to protect their structures from griefing , either on their own or with the assistance of an operator. \n [ edit ] Freebuild \n A middle ground between survival and creative servers, this type of server requires players to gather certain materials in the traditional way, but allows them to use infinite amounts of other materials, usually common materials like wood, stone, sand, and other plentiful resources. \n [ edit ] Roleplay \n This type of server encourages or requires players to assume the role of their character. Usually this means that there is a system in place which allows the player\'s ingame character to be customized, frequently by assuming species, social ranks, superhuman abilities, and the like. These servers are frequently modified with proprietary software to provide players with special powers in exchange for choosing a player class, species, etc. \n [ edit ] Hardcore PvP \n This type of server is usually unmodified or very lightly modified with proprietary software. Subtypes of this server type including Anarchy and Chaos servers, Hardcore PvP servers generally have few rules and encourage killing, looting, and griefing other players. \n [ edit ] Prison \n Constructed to emulate life in Prison, this type of server is comprised of a prison where players spawn, sometimes with multiple "cell blocks" which players advance through in order to gain freedom. This type of server must be modified with proprietary software to control players and simulate a Prison experience. \n [ edit ] Challenge \n Typically consisting of a premade map and the survival game mode, this server offers a variation on the survival mantra such as surviving without the use of a certain material or in unique terrain. Describing a Challenge server is best accomplished by example - Skyblock servers, one type of challenge server, place players on a small island with exactly enough renewable resources to survive and expand the island. \n [ edit ] Economy \n This type of server is modified to introduce a currency system, usually in an intangible form. Players trade in this currency to obtain resources, or hoard it in an attempt to be the wealthiest person on the server. \n [ edit ] City \n This type of server offers one or more areas, usually protected from griefing using proprietary software, in which players can receive \n \n A space to build in, either for free or for some form of currency system as in an economy server. This type of server is rarely unmodified. \n [ edit ] Capture the Flag \n This type of server offers a new type of gamemode for a server. However this usually requires proprietary software. Two teams are chosen and they battle it out, trying to collect the other teams flag and return it to their home point a number of times to win the game. \n [ edit ] SkyBlock \n This type of server forces players to show their legitimate side. This requires proprietary software. Players will spawn on a small island with a chest full of basic items. They will be forced to survive with few items by creating a farm, a cobblestone generator, and other useful renewable devices. These types of servers are sometimes PVP servers. \n [ edit ] KitPvP \n A server in which players choose from a kit or several kits to have big PVP battles. The gamemode is either Adventure or Survival . \n [ edit ] Hunger Games \n Players of these servers have to battle against each other after collecting resources and materials. Last player alive wins. \n [ edit ] Survival Games \n Similar to HungerGames, but players can\'t collect materials. The only way to get geared up is searching for chests hidden everywhere on the map. Winner is the last man standing. \n [ edit ] MineZ \n Based on the Arma II: Combined Operations mod named DayZ, this type of server involves dropping a player into a zombie apocalypse. This is a type of PvP server, and substitutes some Minecraft items for DayZ items, such as paper for bandages. Also, zombies are harder, health does not regenerate, and thirst is added. \n [ edit ] Maintenance \n [ edit ] Delete player \n If you want to delete a player from the game, you can remove the player\'s .dat file. Navigate to the Minecraft server directory, open the world folder, open the player\'s folder, and delete the PLAYERNAME.dat file. In Minecraft version 1.4.6, this folder is at "minecraft\\world\\players", where "minecraft" is the folder where Minecraft was installed on the server. This will cause the player to start over at the spawn point with no inventory. The player\'s changes to the world will be untouched, along with any inventory stored in chests. This will not ban the player that has been deleted. \n [ edit ] Ban player \n If you want to ban a player from playing on your server, edit the minecraft\\banned-ips.txt", where "minecraft" is the folder where minecraft was installed on the server and add the user you want to ban to this banned-ips.txt file. Bans an IP address from the server, the full IP address must be specified; wildcards are not valid. Players who are banned through this method will see "Your IP address is banned from this server!" when attempting to connect. Alternatively an operator can use the "ban-ip" command via "ban-ip ipaddress" where "ipaddress" is the IP address of the user you wish to ban. This can be undone via the operator issuing the "pardon-ip ipaddress" command or editing the server\'s banned-ips.txt file \n [ edit ] Edit player \n If you don\'t want to delete a player completely, but want to remove something from him or move him to a different spot, or even give him an enchanted item, you can edit the PLAYERNAME.dat file with NBTedit similar to how you would a level save. (Only the player needs to be offline. No server restart needed.) \n [ edit ] Creating backups \n Enter save-all into the console or /save-all in Minecraft (as a server op). \nEnter save-off into the console or /save-off in Minecraft (as a server op). \n Copy the world folder to create the backup. DO NOT MOVE IT! (No server restart needed) \nEnter save-on into the console or /save-on in Minecraft (as a server op). \n [ edit ] Resetting the Nether or the End \n Ensure there are no players in that dimension, stop the server. Delete the "DIM-1" folder to reset The Nether , delete the "DIM1" folder to reset The End . Any builds inside those dimensions will be lost, the Ender Dragon will also reappear for The End . \nRestart the server. \n [ edit ] Setting the server\'s texture pack \n You can set a default texture pack for your server and the client will download it and use it for your server. (Please note: the client can turn off the texture pack) \n \n Choose a texture pack. \n Upload the texture pack to Dropbox, or similar. The important thing is that you can have a DIRECT link to the .zip file. \n Set the file to public. (at least on Dropbox) \n Open your server.properties file. \n Find texture-pack= and edit it like this: texture-pack=&lt;link to your .zip&gt; . For example: texture-pack= http://dl.dropbox.com/Server_Texture.zip \n Restart the server &amp; log on to check the texture pack \n \n [ edit ] Death messages \n Death messages are broadcast to everyone on the server upon a player\'s death. These messages relate to how the player died and some are intended to be humorous. Death messages were added in Beta 1.8 Pre-release. New death messages were added in Snapshot 13w02a. \n Anvil \n \n [player] was squashed by a falling anvil \n \n Cactus \n \n [player] was pricked to death \n [player] walked into a cactus whilst trying to escape [player/mob] \n \n Dispenser when using arrows \n \n [player] was shot by arrow \n \n Drowning \n \n [player] drowned \n [player] drowned whilst trying to escape [player/mob] \n \n Explosion \n \n [player] blew up \n [player] was blown up by [player/mob] \n \n Falling \n \n [player] hit the ground too hard\n \n Only caused if the player is killed by a short fall or Ender Pearl damage. \n \n \n [player] fell off a ladder \n [player] fell off some vines \n [player] fell out of the water \n [player] fell from a high place \n [player] fell into a patch of fire \n [player] fell into a patch of cacti \n [player] was doomed to fall (by [mob/player]) \n [player] was shot off some vines by [mob/player] \n [player] was shot off a ladder by [mob/player] \n [player] was blown from a high place by [mob]\n \n Only caused if knockback from a Creeper explosion or Ghast fireball causes the player to fall to their death. \n \n \n \n Fire \n \n [player] went up in flames \n [player] burned to death \n [player] was burnt to a crisp whilst fighting [player/mob] \n [player] walked into a fire whilst fighting [player/mob] \n \n Mob \n \n [player] was slain by [mob] \n [player] was shot by [mob]\n \n Only caused by mobs with projectile attacks \n \n \n [player] was fireballed by [mob]\n \n Only caused by Blazes and Ghasts \n \n \n [player] was killed by [mob] using magic\n \n Only caused by Witches \n \n \n [player] got finished off by [mob] using [weapon] \n [player] was slain by [mob] using [weapon] \n \n Lava \n \n [player] tried to swim in lava \n [player] tried to swim in lava while trying to escape [player/mob] \n \n Other \n \n [player] died (shows when killed by lightning) \n \n Player versus Player (PvP) \n \n [player] got finished off by [player] using [weapon] \n [player] was slain by [player] using [weapon] \n [player] was shot by [player]\n \n Only happens for kills using a bow \n \n \n [player] was killed by [player] using magic\n \n Only happens for kills using a splash potion \n \n \n \n Potion of Harming \n \n [player] was killed by magic\n \n Only happens when the potion is shot from a dispenser, by drinking it, or with the effect command \n \n \n \n Starvation \n \n [player] starved to death \n \n Suffocation \n \n [player] suffocated in a wall \n \n Thorns Enchantment \n \n [player] was killed while trying to hurt [player/mob]\n \n Can be caused by a mob if it is able to wear armor \n \n \n \n Unused \n \n [victim] was pummeled by [killer] Happens when killed by a Snowball , a Egg or an Ender Pearl \n \n This message is never used since snowballs, chicken eggs and ender pearls do not cause any damage to players, it will only hit them. \n Void (including /kill command) \n \n [player] fell out of the world \n [player] fell from a high place and fell out of the world \n [player] was knocked into the void by [player/mob] \n \n Wither effect \n \n [player] withered away \n \n [ edit ] Renting a server \n While you can build your own server, sometimes renting a server can be a better option if your Internet or computer can\'t handle the amount of players you want on the server. You can search for hosts on the Internet, or find them in the Minecraft Server Hosting section of the Minecraft Forums or similar websites. Avoid sites that don\'t have good reputation or look suspicious, these hosts may often be simply out looking for your money and may not provide the best service. \n [ edit ] Realms \n There will be an option to make small servers with the Realms server hosting feature in the future, although it will cost money. \n [ edit ] External links \n \n How to rent a Minecraft server \n Server Mod Directory

For the entity that items and blocks turn into when dropped, see Item (entity) . \n Items are objects which only exist within the player\'s inventory and hands - i.e., they cannot be placed in the game world. Some items simply place blocks or entities into the game world when used. They are thus an item when in the inventory and a block when placed. Some examples of objects which exhibit these properties are item frames , which turn into an entity when placed, and beds , which turn into a group of blocks when placed. When equipped, items and blocks briefly display their names above the HUD. \n Items use item IDs while blocks use block IDs. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Types \n 2 History \n 3 See also \n 4 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Types \n \n Materials : are used for crafting , farming or brewing and can be obtained by mining , crafting, smelting , trading , killing mobs or found in reward chests . \n \n \n Food is found or crafted by the player and eaten to regain hunger points. \n \n \n Potions are craftable and drinkable (or throwable ) items that confer specific effects. Producing them requires resources from The Nether . In order to create a splash potion, you need to add gunpowder to any normal potion. The change cannot be reversed. \n \n \n Tools are used for a variety of purposes:\n \n The "pole tools" ( axe , pickaxe , shovel , hoe ) are mostly used to break blocks faster than mining by hand, and are required in order to retrieve resources from some blocks. The exception is the hoe , which converts dirt into farmland for growing crops. \n Buckets can transport liquids such as milk , lava , and water . \n Fishing rods allow the player to go fishing, as well as to pull mobs closer. \n Flint and steel is used to set flammable blocks on fire (for varying periods of time) and can be used to create a Nether Portal . A fire charge also gives the same effect, but at greater distance if shot from a dispenser.. \n Shears are used to collect wool from sheep , string from cobwebs , mushrooms from mooshrooms , tall grass , leaves , and vines . They can also be used to collect tripwire without setting off a redstone charge. \n \n \n \n \n Informative items , consisting of map , compass and clock , assist the player in the navigation of the landscape, showing direction and the telling of time. Also book and quills and signs can be used for writing. \n \n \n Weapons ( swords , bows , arrows ) are used to defend the player from hostile mobs roaming a map, or to kill passive mobs for food and materials. \n \n \n Armor protects the player from several kinds of damage ( mobs / players , lava , explosions , being in a fire block). A full set of armor is composed of a helmet , a chestplate , a pair of leggings , and a pair of boots . \n \n \n Vehicles , ( minecarts , saddle , carrot on a stick and boats ) allow the player or items to travel over land or water with relative speed and ease. Variations on minecarts have an assortment of purposes. \n \n \n Utility are used for many tasks, such as logic components in redstone circuits or brewing or enchanting -related things. \n \n \n Decorations are items that only have aesthetic uses. \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n December 11th, 2012 \n Dinnerbone tweeted a picture of diamonds being rendered in 3D as dropped items. [1] He also revealed that other items will also be rendered in this way, but only in fancy graphics . [2] \n \n \n December 12th, 2012 \n TeamMojang (YouTube) posted a video showing off the new 3D items.

You can often get around this by pressing the fn key while you press an F-key. To make F-keys work in OS X, go to the Apple menu \xe2\x86\x92 System Preferences \xe2\x86\x92 Keyboard and mouse and check the "Use F1, F2 etc. as normal keys". If you choose the first option, you can then use the fn key to switch F-keys back to actions they used to do (e.g. play/pause music, etc). \n \n \n \n Default \n Function \n \n \n  \n Turning; aiming; third person camera movement. \n \n \n  \n Scrolls through the quick-bar. \n \n \n 1 - 9 \n Selects the appropriate quick-bar item. \n \n \n Esc \n Opens up the menu and gives back cursor control. Pauses Singleplayer games. Closes any open GUI. Exits the chat/command window. \n \n \n F1 \n Toggles the Heads-Up Display . \n \n \n F2 \n Simply pressing this key will take a screenshot and place it in: \n %appdata%\\.minecraft\\screenshots on Windows \n ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/screenshots in OS X \n ~/.minecraft/screenshots in Linux. \n Use this in conjunction with F1 to take screenshots without the HUD. \n \n \n \n F3 \n Pressing this key will toggle the showing of extra debug information on the top of the screen along side the Minecraft version, such as FPS (frames per second), chunk updates, and available memory.\n Pressing the keys 1 - 9 while in the debug screen will show you a more detailed view of the graph on the right. Pressing 0 will show you a less detailed graph. \n Pressing S while holding F3 will reload all web-loaded client resources. \n Pressing A while holding F3 will reload all chunks. \n Pressing T while holding F3 will reload all textures, which is useful for texture pack authors. \n Pressing F while holding F3 will change render distance a.k.a. "fog", from farther to nearer. Before 1.8 this function was assigned to the F (which was changeable) button. \n Holding \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift while pressing F3 and F will reverse the fog toggling, going from nearer to farther. \n Pressing P while holding F3 will toggle the auto-pause when the window loses focus. \n Pressing H while holding F3 will toggle detailed item descriptions. \n \n Shows tool and armor durability on damaged items \n Shows up a map level \n \n Pressing C while holding F3 for at least 6 seconds will trigger a manual debug crash on purpose after the keys are released. \n Pressing B while holding F3 will toggle showing the hitbox around entities. \n \n \n \n F5 \n Toggles between first person, third person from the back and third person from the front. \n \n \n F8 \n Toggles mouse smoothing. Looking around becomes a slow, smooth and more cinematic motion. \n \n \n F10 \nor \n Left Alt \n On Windows, focuses on the icon of the window and freezes all of Minecraft\'s processes, thus stopping setting the location of the mouse to the center of the window and letting the cursor become visible, although the cursor bounds stay the same. This allows you to think twice before taking a screenshot. Holding a movement key then toggling this on then off again will make that key stuck on, even if it is let go. Pressing the same movement key again will stop it. \n \n \n F11 \n Toggles full-screen mode.\n When using some Apple keyboards, F11 must be pressed while holding fn and alt to enter fullscreen. Using F11 alone toggles Expos\xc3\xa9, and pressing F11 while holding fn will turn the volume down or vice versa, depending on system preferences. \n Some people are experiencing a bug while exiting from full-screen mode that causes an inescapable black screen. When that\'s the case, use ALT+TAB to switch out of Minecraft and switch it back to windowed mode. \n On Linux, mouse input is often buggy while in full-screen mode. \n Also, note that this may not respect multiple monitors and Minecraft may occupy all screens instead of the one it is active on. \n \n \n \n \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift \n When the inventory is open, Shift + clicking on an item or stack moves it between the inventory and the hotbar.\n When a chest is open, Shift + clicking on an item will move the entire stack between the chest and the inventory. \n When a furnace is open, Shift + clicking an item or stack in the furnace moves it to the inventory, and Shift + clicking an item or stack in the inventory moves it into the "item" (not fuel) slot of the furnace. \n When crafting , Shift + clicking the crafted item automatically crafts the maximum number of that item for the materials being used, and moves all crafted items to the inventory. \n In the survival inventory tab of the creative inventory , Shift + left click on the red \'Delete\' field clears the whole inventory. \n When in the Multiplayer server selection menu, Shift + up and Shift + down moves a server name to a specific position. You can also hold shift while a server name is selected left click another server name and they will swap. \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Configurable controls \n \n \n Default \n In-game option name \n Function \n \n \n  \n Button 1 (Attack or Dig ) \n Destroy blocks (hold down); Attack (click once); Split a stack evenly (hold and drag); sort loose items into one stack (double-click) \n \n \n  \n Button 2 (Use Item) \n Place blocks; Place one item from a stack in each inventory slot (hold and drag); toggle switches / doors (click once), charge a bow (release to fire); block using a sword ; use special blocks like chests , doors, and switches ; enter vehicles .\n Also: Eat food , hoe farmland , shear sheep . Commonly, if both the item held and the block clicked on has a such purpose (like trying to place dirt on a chest), the block will overrule the item. This also means a player can punch an entity while eating/drinking, however the eating/drinking will reset when a player presses Button 1. \n \n \n \n  \n Pick Block \n Switch to the block currently looked at, as long as it is in the quickbar. In Creative mode , if the block is not in the quickbar, replaces the currently active quickbar slot with the block currently looked at. Clicking on a mob will give that mob\'s spawn egg, if there is one. Clicking on a painting , minecart (with or without chest or furnace), or boat will give the corresponding item.\n Hovering over an item in an inventory and clicking with the mouse wheel when in creative gives the maximum stack of that item. \n \n \n \n W \n Forward \n Move forward. When double-tapped, causes the player to sprint (unless in water , Fly Mode is on, or the character is too hungry ). \n \n \n A \n Left \n Strafe left. \n \n \n S \n Back \n Move backward and when double-tapped, while holding forward, will cause the player to sprint (unless in water , Fly Mode is on, or the character is too hungry ). \n \n \n D \n Right \n Strafe right. \n \n \n Spacebar \n Jump \n Jump. When double-tapped, toggles Fly Mode ( Creative only). When Fly Mode is on, causes the player to gain altitude (ascend). \n \n \n \xe2\x87\xa7 Left Shift \n Sneak \n Sneak . When Fly Mode is on, causes the player to lose altitude (descend).\n When sneaking, right-clicking places objects like Levers onto blocks that would usually open an internal inventory, such as Dispensers . \n Used to get off ridable entities. \n \n \n \n E \n Inventory \n Open the Inventory . Close any open GUI. \n \n \n Q \n Drop \n Drop/toss an item from the quick-bar. If items are stacked, only one will be thrown/tossed/dropped. [fn 1] Ctrl+Q drops the whole stack of items. \n \n \n T \n Chat \n Chat and Server commands. \n \n \n / \n Command \n Opens the chat window with the "/" character already typed. On some keyboards (Nordic layout at least) this button might be asterisk/apostrophe (*/ \' ). \n \n \n Tab \xe2\x86\xb9 \n List Players and Commands \n In Multiplayer hold the Tab key to see a list of players.\n When in the chat window, Tab cycles through possible commands or arguments. \n \n \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n There is no actual "throw" command; "drop" (default Q ) will toss an object approximately 2 to 3 blocks from you. Eggs , Ender Pearls , Eyes of Ender , and Snowballs can be thrown by the "use" command (default right-clicking). Eggs, snowballs, and Ender Pearls fly in an arc; additionally, Ender Pearls teleport you to the location it lands, causing 5 (   ) points of damage. Eyes of Ender fly toward the direction of the nearest Stronghold , and then fall to the ground. \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Pocket Edition \n [ edit ] Phones \n \n \n Function \n Action \n \n \n Movement \n Tap forward, back, left, and right symbols on screen. \n \n \n Jump \n Tap the square symbol on the screen. Also, the character will auto-jump when moving towards a block. \n \n \n Fly \n Tap the square symbol in the screen twice. Hold the square symbol, slide your finger forward to go up, slide your finger back to go down. To move forward, back, left, or right, it\'s the same rules as movement. You can only fly in creative mode. \n \n \n Place Block \n Tap where you would like to place the block. \n \n \n Break Block \n Hold down your finger on the block you want to break. How long it takes to break the block is indicated by a circular icon on the screen. How long it takes to break the block varies on what tool you\'re using to break the block. \n \n \n Move Camera \n Slide your finger across the screen. \n \n \n Screenshot \n Hold the Home button and Power at the same time (iOS) or hold Volume Down and Power at the same time (Android). Android devices will save the screenshot to your Gallery and iOS devices will save the screenshot to your Camera Roll.

They are still accessible, but it requires either remembering how many times one has to press the directional buttons to access them, or trial-and-error. This will hopefully be fixed soon, but is most prominent in the 4.0 update, as the amount of items has increased, and now sixteen items are hidden. The only way to see them is to turn on the option to use touch controls in the options menu. \n [ edit ] Tablets \n Tablets for iOS or Android use the same controls as on phones.

This day will guide you in making a cobblestone house, instead of your dirt home. \n [ edit ] Back to mining \n The foundation of everything is mining. Begin by mining some stone with your pickaxe. When you extract a stone block, it should drop a crumbly block called cobblestone . This is what you can use to make your house. It has an explosion resistance of 30, which isn\'t enough to stop a Creeper \'s explosion but it will do for the second day. You can also use cobblestone to make stone weapons and tools. These last longer, with 132 uses. You can make a stone pickaxe by replacing the wooden planks with cobblestone when making a pickaxe. After crafting it, collect approximately 50-80 pieces of cobblestone. Make sure to light up your mine, otherwise you will be destroyed by the various mobs ! \n \n \n \n  \nThis is what happens if you don\'t light up part of your mine. These are arrows shot from Skeletons . \n \n \n [ edit ] Construction \n By now it should be the middle of the day. Build a three-block high wall that is about 5x4. Then you can seal it over with cobblestone as a roof, or you can make an overhang on the top to prevent spiders climbing in (that means one block along the outside top edge of the hovel where the walls would turn into roof).

You can do this by filling up the crafting table with wooden planks in the first two columns from the left (it works from the right too). Collect the wooden door and place it in the gap of your house. Right-clicking on it will open it. Right-clicking it again will close it. \n You can also craft an iron door if you have iron. (You\'ll want to make a couple of levers and/or pressure plates to go with it, or wooden or stone buttons .) Mobs cannot pass through these doors, but can attack you if you place the door from the inside, certain mobs such as the skeleton, which can fire arrows, will attack through the door. To prevent this, go outside of your house and place the door in the doorway. This will be an outward facing door and prevents attacks. \n \n \n Crafting a Door: \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n    \n   \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n   \n \n \n    \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Fixing tools \n \n Main article: Item Repair \n \n To fix a tool, put two of the same tool in the crafting table next to each other. This will replace the two old items with a new item that is either unused, or has slightly more remaining uses than both the old items together. This applies to any tool that has durability, including swords and bows. Eventually you will have enchanted tools and/or weapons\xe2\x80\x94then you can start using anvils . \n \n \n Fixing a Tool: \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Bed \n If you haven\'t already made a bed , you should get some Wool to make one! Here\'s a reminder for the crafting recipe: \n \n \n Crafting a Bed NOTE: wool and wood could be any kind \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Next Day \n Here\'s a tutorial for The Third Day . \n [ edit ] Tips \n \n Can\'t get your head around a crafting table? See Crafting for everything you need to know about crafting tables, including recipes. \n If you are hungry or low on health, kill a passive mob , or cut down some trees or do something else to get food (see fishing rod ). As of 1.1, tree leaves now drop apples , which can be eaten. Collect them if you find them, but they are rare so don\'t rely on them. \n If you have less than 3.5 hunger points, you can\'t sprint. If you have 9 or more hunger points, you will slowly recover health. \n Bed not working? Get on the same level as the bed, and then try it. If that doesn\'t work, make sure there are no monsters around you, and that it\'s nighttime. You should drift off to sleep. For more help, talk on the discussion page for more help from fellow Minecrafters. Also, make sure your bed is not obstructed, otherwise, when you die you will return to your original spawn point upon death, which could be far away. \n Do not mine a recolored coal-like block unless you\'re using something better than a wooden pickaxe. Destroying this kind of block with a pickaxe that isn\'t of the right type will prevent it from dropping an object. Check the ores for more information regarding the different types of ores and the tools required. You can easily determine if you cannot mine a block if it takes too long to mine it. \n If you feel that your home is too far from your original spawn point, just relocate your house. If it is made of weak materials (Dirt, wood, etc.) then you can just break it and move it closer to your original spawn point. If your house and/or bed is destroyed by Creepers or many aggressive mobs are near or in your house, having your home close to your spawn point will help you. You can easily find your house without looking for a few minutes and risk being killed again. \n Remember that your items disappear within 5 minutes of your death. Get to your items quickly, or you could have to start over! \n \n [ edit ] Tutorial Videos \n \n The Second Day in Minecraft 1.0.0 (SecretRevelation) \n \n \n \n Tutorials \n \n \n Introductory \n \n

For other uses, see Seeds (disambiguation) . \n Minecraft seeds are values made up of characters (including numbers), or just one character, that is used as the basis for generating every Minecraft world. [1] \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 World generation \n 2 Determining the seed \n 3 Technical \n 4 History \n 5 External links \n \n 5.1 Seed extraction \n \n \n 6 References \n \n \n \n \n World generation \n Whenever the game has to generate a new world, it calls upon an algorithm. This algorithm will output a pseudo-random value that is then used to determine what the world will look like. However, the algorithm will always end up with the same value if the starting point (seed) that the algorithm uses is the same number. \nThis is why seeds exist-to easily generate entirely different worlds from a single value. \n Whenever the world generation algorithm is updated, the same seed will no longer generate the same terrain. This is why in some different versions of the game, the same seed will not give the same world. \n A world\'s seed is set when that world is created. By default, it is decided automatically (if so, the game uses the system time as the seed), but it can also be set manually. Set and reuse a seed to replay that world, or use a known seed to play the same world as another player. Either a number or a word/phrase can be used, including negatives. \n If the seed or generator changes in a saved world, new chunks will be based on the new seed, and will not match those from the old seed (this phenomenon was widely observed with the Adventure Update ). Deleted chunks can regenerate if the seed and generator remains the same, but will change if either the seed or generator changes. \n It is important to note that since seeds are simply random values read into an algorithm and not actually names of different worlds, using a certain seed will not necessarily result in a world with any relevance to the value of that seed. For instance, using a biome name as your seed will not necessarily result in the creation of a world with primarily that biome. \n Determining the seed \n To view the world\'s seed, the player must enter the command /seed . \n Technical \n The Java String.hashCode() function is used to generate a number seed if a word/phrase is used. This restricts Minecraft to a subset of the possible worlds (around 4 billion), due to the datatypes used. Use number seeds directly or let Minecraft generate the seed (it uses the system clock) to access the full set of possible worlds (around 281 trillion). \n History \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.3 \n It is now possible to manually determine the seed. \n \n \n 1.8.1 \n The debug screen now displays the seed number. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.2 \n Multiplayer servers will no longer send the seed to clients. \n \n \n 12w18a \n Due to singleplayer becoming multiplayer, the world\'s seed is no longer displayed on the debug screen. \n \n \n 12w21a \n Added console command, "/seed", that displays the current world seed. \n \n \n External links \n Seed extraction \n \n SeedScope.net: Webapp requiring uploaded savegame files. \n Random Seed Reader: Local Java tool \n \n References \n \n

Popularized in Minecraft by teams, griefing has become a serious problem for server administrators who wish to foster building and protect builders. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 History of griefing \n 2 Basic griefing methods and prevention \n 3 Griefing clients \n 4 Other Griefing Methods \n 5 Anti-griefing \n \n 5.1 How to prevent griefing \n 5.2 Anti-griefing server modifications \n \n \n 6 See also \n 7 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History of griefing \n Griefing is far from a new phenomenon in video games. It dates to the late 1990s, when it was used to describe the willfully antisocial behaviors seen in early massively multiplayer online games like Ultima Online and first-person shooters like Counter-Strike . [1] [1] Frustrated users or mal-intentioned gamers have oftentimes tried to cause grief among other players in multiplayer servers they join, but many griefers just "do it for the lulz", [1] or just out of plain boredom. [2] An increase in organized griefing occurred with the creation of teams producing their own videos which popularized Minecraft griefing. Fortunately for server administrators, the increase in griefing has pushed the creation of numerous anti-griefing tools and techniques . \n [ edit ] Basic griefing methods and prevention \n \n \n Method \n Description \n How To Prevent \n \n \n Destruction \n Self-explanatory. Most griefers\' goals are to destroy as much land, buildings and creations as they can in order to make the server as destroyed and unusable as possible. This can include Creative "nuking", where users can instantly destroy all blocks in reach, or "torch nuking" when the griefer destroys only torches (many hacked clients have these as built in features). A more time-consuming and generally expensive method of griefing is creation of TNT cannons to bombard other players\' creations from a safe distance. In very rare cases, they will cut out a fairly large chunk of your house, usually in a square, and fill it with water, to make it harder for you to re-build it.\n Another approach is to pack every open space in a house with TNT and light it. \n \n This can be avoided with block and chunk protection plugins. Logging/Rollback plugins can completely undo the damage done by individual griefers. Restricting TNT will render cannons worthless. \n \n \n Creation \n Nearly as frequently as simple destruction of servers, griefers also often attempt to create offensive structures such as swastikas, and nude or offensive pixel art. Also, cages around players that are AFK are built, often of materials unable to mined with tools obtained early on, like obsidian . Sometimes players even surround other players\' structures with obsidian, sand or gravel , sometimes with bedrock(by creative users) (the latter two are annoying due to their falling properties). \n Logging/Rollback plugins can completely undo the damage done by individual griefers. \n \n \n Chat Spamming \n Chat spam is simply typing large amounts of messages in chat and sending them, often randomly. The result of this can be server lag, which thus makes chat spam more of an annoyance rather than vandalism. \n Stopping chat spam is relatively easy with spam protection plugins. \n \n \n Abusive Mob Spawning \n This form of griefing is spawning mobs to the point that the server lags, which if lagged enough, can corrupt the map and render it unusable. If the spawned mobs are hostile, then they can be especially destructive on PvP servers. Creepers , Withers , and "endermobs" ( Endermen and the Ender Dragon ) are even more destructive as they can move and destroy blocks. Spawn eggs made this even more of a problem. \n The /killall command can easily dispatch of the spawned mobs (though one must watch out; it does destroy Minecarts , Boats , and Paintings ). You can get the command through various plugins. To prevent it altogether, there are plugins stopping mobs from spawning. \n \n \n Lava / Water Flooding \n If able, griefers often will attempt to place as much lava (preferable because of its killing properties) and water around a map in order to make it as ugly and dangerous as possible. Rarely, water and lava can be used in conjunction to create massive amounts of cobblestone, or even rarer, obsidian, very quickly. \n The best way to prevent this from happening is to simply limit who is able to place lava or water. If the damage has already been done, the best way to remove it is with world editing plugins. \n \n \n Spawn Killing \n On servers with PvP enabled, some players will take advantage of this to kill legitimate players as they spawn (because the spawn point/area is predictable). The use of client modifications such as "Kill Aura" is frequently used to give the griefer a large advantage. \n The most effective way at preventing this is to disable PvP in the spawn area with server plugins and provide multiple exits for newly spawned players to escape from (a single exit point is very predictable). \n \n \n Tree Griefing \n For a long time, block logging plugins did not have the ability to roll back the growth of trees. Because of this, many griefers will place saplings and use bonemeal (if available) to grow full trees in the locations where houses once stood, preventing rollbacks from easily undoing their damage. \n Previously, server admins would restrict the use of saplings and bonemeal, however that lead to problems for normal players. Luckily, logging/rollback plugins are now able to track and undo player-grown trees. \n \n \n Fire Griefing \n Most builders use a lot of flammable materials, and if the server has fire spread enabled, a griefer armed with a Flint and Steel can destroy a lot, very quickly, including setting themselves on fire. Fire was nerfed in Beta 1.6 and currently does much less damage than it once had. However, this can still burn a large chunk of flammable objects. \n Disable fire spread with world protection plugins, or use /gamerule doFireTick false \n \n \n Social Engineering \n Social Engineering is any technique used as an attempt to gain the trust of people by acting as a normal player or creating a situation where the legitimate players need to trust them. A common trick that griefers use is pretending to be from popular Minecraft websites, or popular Minecraft teams/clans and asking for OP status in order to "review" the server. This is not a typical form of destruction griefing, however this is a strategy employed by many griefers to gain trust and cause rage, or it may be done to get OP status, and cause great destruction. \n Be very careful who gets administrator tools, make sure that you know them well enough to trust them with power. \n \n \n Trolling \n Trolls like to annoy people, rather than grief. There are several ways to troll, such as killing a person and them watching while you throw their diamond pickaxe into lava, spamming, and promising to give them stuff, giving them the stuff, then killing them the moment they go out of a safe zone. \n Most of these cannot be blocked, though they are usually easy to notice. A troll always wants you to see what he or she has done so he or she could annoy you more. A good temp ban will solve things. Most times, you only need to ban the person for a day. \n \n \n Map Corrupting \n A relatively rare form of griefing, map corrupting is simply making the map file as big as possible, usually by running as far as they can. This can lead to a lot of lag in the server, and can make the map size so big that it cannot be loaded. If a backup is not available, then the map may need to be deleted and all structures will be lost. This was a large issue before the Beta switch to a new chunk managing method. \n Some plugins can limit the size of a map, and some make automatic saves/backups of the file. \n \n \n Combat Logging \n Combat logging is mostly a problem on PvP servers. Combat logging is when you\'re in combat with someone and they log off while you\'re fighting them. It does not inflict harm, but like trolling, just annoys people and causes frustration. Sometimes PvP logging is the sign of a desperate player trying to stay alive. \n Some plugins can "tag" people when they get hit whilst in combat, which will create a penalty if they log out. \n \n \n Lag Generation \n Item drops, redstone , minecarts , and boats have a long history of causing strain on servers and clients. A griefer may attempt to lag out a certain area of the map by placing a lot of the aforementioned items into a small area, forcing both server and client to handle a lot of different things at once. This form of griefing is especially prevalent in creative servers where obtaining these lag-inducing blocks is incredibly easy. \n Limit creation placement of certain blocks that have a tendency to cause lag and research plugins that will remove item drops on a regular basis. \n \n \n There are other forms of griefing, however they are simply variations on the ones listed above. Essentially, if moderators are attentive and the server is equipped with the necessary plugins, a server can be very secure from griefing. \n [ edit ] Griefing clients \n While modifications to Minecraft clients are fairly popular with legitimate mods , griefers also often employ client modifications to aid their efforts. Apart from the mods below, griefing clients often include an ingame GUI to display enabled mods, as well as things such as chat commands (".commands") and keybinds to easily turn hacks on and off. \n \n \n \n  \nA hacked client, showing its ingame GUI. \n \n \n \n Kill Aura or Forcefield : Kill auras, and similar mods called ForceFields, automatically hit/attack any players or mobs within the range of the player. \n Aimbot : Aimbot is a hack which does what might seem obvious: It aims at the closest player or mob, which allows the user of the aimbot to get a better hit. These are often combined with Kill Auras. \n Autosoup : This hack is used to automatically switch to a full soup in your inventory, eat it, then switch back to your first slot/weapon. It is used on Kitpvp servers which utilize an autoeat plugin, while using it you are practically invincible until you run out of soup. \n Build : Build hacks are simply modifications that instantly place blocks in a predetermined pattern. Common builds include cubes, pillars, swastikas, and platforms. \n Critical : This hack is used make sure you always hit a critical attack upon another player and/or mob. There\'s one which forces it without actually jumping, and one which jumps before attacking. Both are effective. \n ESP : This hack draws a 3D box around the player which is viewable from a long distance and through blocks to locate the player, in some cases, also displays some info; Object in hand, armor, co-ords. \n FastPlace : This modification eliminates the normal delay when placing blocks. This may also be applied to placing eggs in order to create a lot of entities in a short amount of time. \n Flight or Fly : Not necessarily used just for griefing, this hack gives the user the ability to fly similar to as if he or she was in Creative mode, often at adjustable speed levels. \n Spider &#160;: This mod, similar to but less obvious as flight, causes every block the player encounters to be treated as if it had vines, allowing access to areas not normally accessible, used for griefing and especially for PvP. \n Freecam : This mod allows the user to separate him or herself from his or her body and fly around to scout out areas. Since infinite reach was patched, the user of this mod cannot affect any blocks outside his or her reach radius. However, this hack can be used to freecam into obsidian bases, and open chests within the player\'s reach distance. \n Fullbright : This hack lights up all blocks as if they were in direct sunlight, even in pitch blackness. The addition of the "Night Vision" potion in Snapshot 12w32a makes this feature obtainable in vanilla Minecraft. \n Godmode : This makes the user invincible, preventing them from being able to take damage. Almost all versions of this hack have been patched, but there are still some versions which still exist. \n HighJump : This allows the player to jump higher than normal, often at an adjustable jump height. \n NoFall : This hack prevents damage from being taken when falling from high areas. \n Nuker or Annihilator : This destroys all blocks within reach radius automatically and quickly. They are also often configurable, allowing the user to destroy only certain block types. \n Sneak : This allows griefers to sneak indefinitely, and without being slowed down. This will keep their nameplates hidden behind walls just as if they were holding the sneak button. \n Spam or Flood : This allows the client to send a large number of chat messages to the server, and often very quickly. This is partially patched in vanilla, with the "disconnect.spam" kick message if you send messages too fast. \n SpeedMine or FastBreak : This allows the user to break blocks much faster than normal. It does not usually work on blocks such as obsidian, however. \n Instant or OneClick : These may sound similar to SpeedMine, but it is not the same thing. Instant and OneClick both allow the user to click blocks once without holding their mouse down, and a short time after, the block will break as if they had clicked and held to break it. This makes it easier to destroy multiple blocks quickly. \n Step : This modification allows for the user to simply walk up multiple blocks as if they were half steps . The number of blocks is usually adjustable. \n Tracers : This hack draws a line, which starts at the crossarrow, and ends at another players position. It is used to locate a player accurately. \n X-Ray or Wallhack : Stops the rendering of any block besides ones desirable to the griefer. This hack is often used to find chests or valuable minerals such as diamond. It can be partially prevented using server plugins that disguise ores and chests that are not adjacent to transparent blocks. \n Sprint or Speed : This will make the player sprint at the normal sprint speed, or faster. Most of the time, this will not deplete hunger. \n \n [ edit ] Other Griefing Methods \n \n Join Bots : Join bots, such as "PWN4G3", "World\'s End", "Paradigm", or "DarkBot" are used to join tens or hundreds of accounts ("bots") to a server at once, usually to lag or spam the server. There are multiple methods they can use, such as connecting and disconnecting rapidly, chat spamming, drop spamming (In Creative mode), and slot filling. They are often hard to ban due to the fact that they use many accounts and proxies. Proxies make every connection that the spammer makes to the server appear to come from a different PC, thus preventing IP bans. Join bots can be combatted with a good antispam plugin. \n \n [ edit ] Anti-griefing \n [ edit ] How to prevent griefing \n While there is not much that can stop a determined griefer, there are ways for a server to mitigate the risks of being griefed. The following is a list of steps server owners can take to try to keep their server protected: \n \n Protect the server with appropriate anti-griefing plugins. \n Do not let administrators abuse their power (this can incite anger in users and bring about griefing). Also, be cautious in choosing who to give administrative permissions to begin with. \n \n \n \n \n Should power abuse happen in severe cases, it may be a wise idea to be the only administrator. \n \n \n \n \n Be careful what permissions to which people have access. Owners can limit access with Server modifications . \n Be careful where the server is advertised. While more exposure means more members, it also means griefers can find it just as easily. \n Become familiar with what griefers are capable of doing. There are no hacks "to gain op" or "delete the server". If one takes the time to learn what is possible (by watching griefing videos from popular teams and reading griefing forums), you will be more able to counter it. \n Change servers so that only friends (or owner) can do things big (but not grief if they want to). \n \n For a much more in-depth (and anti-grief biased) analysis, see Crayboff\'s thread on the topic. \n [ edit ] Anti-griefing server modifications \n While there are many people creating grief-friendly client modifications, there are equally dedicated programmers creating server plugins to foil their attempts. Using the popular and extensible Bukkit server software and other Server Mods , programmers have made numerous add-ons to enforce correct client behavior. There are plugins that allow administrators to log and rollback all edits done on an individual basis, employ jails to trap griefers, and even protect certain blocks or entire chunks. \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Griefing - Wikipedia essay on griefing. \n Griefer - Wikipedia article on the griefer. \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 a  b  c \n "Mutilated Furries, Flying Phalluses: Put the Blame on Griefers, the Sociopaths of the Virtual World" .

Both Alpha and Beta buyers got the full game free of charge) and minor updates to the main website. \n [ edit ] Features \n \n For a full list of changes, see Beta version history \n \n \n New Minecraft logo and launcher. \n Achievements and statistics . \n Server -side inventory . \n Creative game mode . \n Weather effects: rain and snow . \n Rewritten biome codes. \n More variety in trees . \n New lighting mechanics. \n New graphical effects, including improved sunrise/sunset, water bubbles, explosions , and Void particles. \n Naturally generated structures such as Strongholds , Abandoned Mine Shafts and Villages . \n New mobs including squid , Enderman , Silverfish , Cave Spider and tameable wolves . \n New health mechanic using hunger and stackable food items. \n New combat mechanics such as critical hits , charged bows , experience orbs , sprinting and blocking . \n New mechanisms.

This is about 1.3x faster than the normal walking speed of around 4.3&#160;m/s. The player sprints by double tapping the "Forward" key ( W by default) and then holding it, or by holding forward and double tapping reverse. It is possible to jump across four blocks horizontally (although difficult), instead of the usual two blocks by sprinting, however the jump height is no higher than normal. [1] \n Sprinting is unlimited as long as the Food Bar is above 30% (3 shanks), but it also depletes the bar at a rate of 1/2 a food unit every 40 meters, or 7 seconds, as long as the foodSaturationLevel is at 0. When a player sprints, particles come from the player\'s feet corresponding to the block type they are running on. When a player attacks any mobs (excluding squid ) while sprinting, the mob suffers a large knock back. [2] \n Sprinting stops when you collide with a solid block or perform a sneaking action such as blocking . You do not stop sprinting when you run into a mob. Attacking a mob stops your sprint, but breaking a block doesn\'t. It is possible to make turns with the "left" and "right" keys (by default, A and D respectively) while sprinting without slowing down, thus altering the direction of where you go. \n After switching on the "sprinting state" the field of view also slightly changes (increases FOV by 10) to give the impression of increased speed. Notch was originally going to add a thirst mechanic along with hunger, but sprinting was planned as well in the next update, making sprinting too "expensive" to use. [ citation&#160;needed ] \n In the Xbox 360 Edition , in Creative mode, sprinting while flying will cause the player to "sprint-fly", causing them to travel at approximately 6 m per second. Also, on the PC version, if you are in creative mode and then double tap jump, you will start flying at an increased speed. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Video \n 2 History \n 3 Issues \n 4 Trivia \n 5 Gallery \n 6 See also \n 7 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n Sprinting was mentioned at PAX 2011; the sprinting mechanic would expand the combat system and increase player mobility. [3] \n Jeb uploaded a video on September 2, 2011, featuring the difference between sprinting and regular walking. [4] \n Sprinting was implemented in Beta 1.8pre1 along with flying , and was officially added in Beta 1.8 , the Adventure Update . \n [ edit ] Issues \n Issues relating to "Sprinting" are maintained on Mojira. Report issues there. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n When sprinting in water you get a very minor speed boost, but it isn\'t very noticeable. On the other hand, bobbing in water (holding down jump while swimming) gets you around faster. \n Sprinting and holding down jump at the same time usually makes you go faster on land - if under the effect of a high level speed potion, sprinting alone is faster than sprinting and jumping. \n Ocelots , Iron Golems and Baby Villagers are the only mobs that can sprint like the player. \n Sprinting and jumping (spamming the "jump" key) while under a low (2-block high) ceiling causes a player to move at a speed almost twice as high as regular sprinting speed. This is rather inefficient, however, as this can easily drain food at a rate of about 1 unit per second, but it proves an excellent form of transport when playing on peaceful, or if one has a large amount of food. \n Doing the same as above, except on top of Ice allows the player to move at an astonishing 16 blocks per second. That is twice as fast as a full speed minecart on powered rails. \n Doing the same as above but with trapdoors just above the ice, one can travel 1000 blocks in 54 seconds (18.518 blocks per second). \n Ocelots and Tamed Cats will often sprint when spooked. Their type of sprinting also includes kicking up specks, and is also known as Clawing. This is likely due to their odd habit (or skill) of sprinting while face-to-face with a wall that is 2 blocks high. They cannot jump over it, so the only indication is the specks flying away from their feet. Thus mimicking a real cat using a Scratching Post. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Particles coming out of the ground while sprinting \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Flying \n Sneaking \n Blocking \n Critical hit \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPWyGGA0mLk \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkSaH_7MGe8 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.minecraftforum.net/news/199-pax-18-game-features/ \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPWyGGA0mLk \n \n \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Sprinting&amp;oldid=500848 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Citation needed Gameplay  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 3 July 2013, at 17:20. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

For information on health/hearts, see Health . \n Damage from attacks or natural causes will subtract hearts from this total. When the total reaches zero you die. When a mob dies, it drops items specific to that mob, Players drop their inventory when they die. Damage is measured through a health gauge and monitor. Each full heart contains two halves, one hit point each (full health is 20 hit points). \n Armor will absorb damage and reduce the number of hit points subtracted from the player\'s (or mob\'s) health (damaging the armor instead). \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Dealing damage \n \n 1.1 Critical hits \n \n 1.1.1 Video \n \n \n 1.2 Damage immunity \n \n \n 2 Damage inflicted by mobs \n \n 2.1 Knockback \n \n \n 3 Natural damage \n \n 3.1 Lightning damage \n 3.2 Fall damage \n 3.3 Drowning \n 3.4 Suffocation \n 3.5 Starvation \n 3.6 Cactus contact \n 3.7 Lava \n 3.8 Poison \n 3.9 The Void \n \n \n 4 History \n 5 Trivia \n 6 See also \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Dealing damage \n Players can deal damage by hitting mobs or other players with items at close (melee) range. A large majority of items only deal 1 (  ) damage. Weapons can be crafted for the express purpose of dealing more damage. Swords are crafted for this purpose. While swords do not extend attack range, they deal significantly more damage than with any other item or tool. Axes , pickaxes , and shovels also deal more damage than bare fists however, with hoes doing the same damage as fists, as detailed on the Weapons page. While falling, melee attacks deal a critical hit (up to 50% + 2 (  ) additional damage, rounded down to the nearest hit point). \n Arrows (shot by holding and releasing right click when wielding a Bow ), snowballs , splash Potions, and chicken eggs are the only ranged weapons in the game. Snowballs only inflict damage on Blazes and the Ender Dragon , while eggs do no damage at all, but still knock mobs back as if they had been damaged. Splash potions can be thrown, inflicting various effects depending on the potion. \n The Flint and steel allows the player to light a block on fire , which causes all players and mobs that touch the fire to be set on fire, with the exception of certain fireproof monsters such as Zombie Pigmen, Magma Cubes, Blazes, Ghasts and Wither Skeletons. Players and mobs that are ignited stay alight until 15 (       ) hit points of damage is dealt or until they touch water. Likewise, contact with Lava also ignites players and mobs. \n TNT is currently the only controllable explosive in Minecraft and is obtained by crafting sand and gunpowder . \n The below values detail the damage dealt per hit using various items. Note that weapons and tools in 1.8 dealt more damage, and that critical damage is not consistent. \n \n \n Item \n Damage \n \n \n Swords \n   \xe2\x80\x8b   \xe2\x80\x8b 4 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 5 (   ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 6 (   ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 7 (    ) \n \n \n Axes [note 1] \n   \xe2\x80\x8b   \xe2\x80\x8b 3 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 4 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 5 (   ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 6 (   ) \n \n \n Pickaxes [note 1] \n   \xe2\x80\x8b   \xe2\x80\x8b 2 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 3 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 4 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 5 (   ) \n \n \n Shovels [note 1] \n   \xe2\x80\x8b   \xe2\x80\x8b 1 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 2 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 3 (  ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 4 (  ) \n \n \n Hoes , hands, and any other item \n 1 (  ) [note 2] \n \n \n Arrows (from a Bow ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 1 (  ) - 10 (     ) [note 3] \n \n \n Fire (Contact) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 1 (  ) \n \n \n Fire (Burning) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 1 (  ) per second \n \n \n Lava (Contact) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 4 (  ) \n \n \n TNT ( Explosion ) \n   \xe2\x80\x8b 24 (  \xc3\x97 12) [note 4] \n \n \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 a  b  c \n dealing damage with an axe, pick, or shovel decreases its durability by 2. \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n Used to be 2 (  ) between Beta 1.5 and Beta 1.8 Pre-release. \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n Depending on charge. \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n The damage will decrease the further it is away from the core of the explosion. \n \n \n [ edit ] Critical hits \n \n \n \n  \nA critical hit performed on a sheared sheep. \n \n \n \' Critical hits\' are attacks that deal extra damage compared to regular attacks. Critical melee strikes, regardless of the weapon used, cause small star particles to fly out of the target who was critically hit. "Critical arrows", which occur when the bow is fired fully charged, leave a trail of the same small star particles as they fly through the air. Critical hits affect all damageable entities including players , mobs , paintings , boats and minecarts . \n In melee, a critical hit occurs when a player attacks a mob while FALLING, not while jumping up. The attack deals a random amount of additional damage, up to 50% more (rounded down) plus one heart. This can be done by jumping. It can also be combined with sprinting to knock back the mob, although there is no extra knockback for a critical hit. \n In an abandoned mine shaft , a player may choose to jump into a cobweb . At the cost of mobility, the player will be granted a major damage increase, as cobwebs greatly extend the time the player falls. \n More specifically, the requirements for a melee critical hit are: \n \n The player must be falling \n The player must not be on the ground \n The player must not be on a ladder/ vine etc. \n The player must not be in water \n The player must not be affected by the Blindness Potion \n The player must not be riding an entity \n \n This is a chart cross-referencing weapons with materials to find the maximum amount of damage dealt from critical hits in version 1.3.2: \n \n \n \n Wood \n Gold \n Stone \n Iron \n Diamond \n \n \n Sword \n 8 (    ) \n 9 (     ) \n 11 (     ) \n 12 (     ) \n \n \n Axe \n 6 (   ) \n 8 (    ) \n 9 (     ) \n 11 (     ) \n \n \n Pickaxe \n 5 (   ) \n 6 (   ) \n 8 (    ) \n 9 (     ) \n \n \n Shovel \n 3 (  ) \n 5 (   ) \n 6 (   ) \n 8 (    ) \n \n \n \nAs fists and arrows do not have a "material", their damage is constant. Although Hoes are tools, they are not counted as weapons and have the same effect as fists (no durability loss and same damage) \n \n \n Fist \n 2 (  ) \n \n \n Arrow \n 10 (     ) \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Damage immunity \n After sustaining damage from any source, a mob will turn red in color for a short period of time. During this period, any other incoming damage will not be counted against the mob\'s total health . For instance, if you attack a mob with a Sword repeatedly hitting the mouse button, the sword\'s rate of fire will exceed the mob\'s allowable rate of incoming damage, and several of the attacks will not damage the mob even if they land. (It is recommended to wait for a mob to be hittable again before swinging your sword, as the durability still goes down, whether or not you dealt damage). However, if a mob or player is recovering from damage and then receives higher damage, it gets counted. Players are also subject to damage immunity. \n [ edit ] Damage inflicted by mobs \n The damage Mobs deal to players is affected by the difficulty of the game. The below values represent the amount of damage taken per hit. \n \n This only applies to mobs attacking the player. Mobs attacking other mobs (wolves, iron golems, etc.) always deal the \'Normal\' damage listed, regardless of difficulty. \n Values for the Creeper and Ghast assume the player is directly adjacent to the explosion. \n The damage of Slimes and Magma Cubes depends on their size. Tiny-sized Slimes, while hostile, are unable to do damage directly. \n The damage done by Zombies depends on their remaining health, increasing as they are injured. \n In contrast, the damage for an Iron Golem just has a large random factor. \n \n \n \n Mob \n Peaceful \n Easy \n Normal \n Hard \n \n \n Blaze \n - \n 4 (  ) \n 6 (   ) \n 9 (     ) \n \n \n Blaze \'s fireball \n - \n 3 (  ) \n 5 (   ) \n 7 (    ) \n \n \n Creeper \'s explosion \n - \n 25 (  \xc3\x97 12.5) \n 49 (  \xc3\x97 24.5) \n 73 (  \xc3\x97 36.5) \n \n \n Charged Creeper \'s explosion \n - \n 49 (  \xc3\x97 24.5) \n 97 (  \xc3\x97 48.5) \n 145 (  \xc3\x97 72.5) \n \n \n Ender Dragon \n - \n 6 (   ) \n 10 (     ) \n 15 (       ) \n \n \n Enderman \n - \n 4 (  ) \n 7 (    ) \n 10 (     ) \n \n \n Ghast \'s fireball \n - \n 9 (     ) \n 17 (  \xc3\x97 8.5) \n 25 (  \xc3\x97 12.5) \n \n \n Iron Golem \n - \n 4 (  ) - 11 (     ) \n 7 (    ) - 21 (  \xc3\x97 10.5) \n 10 (     ) - 31 (  \xc3\x97 15.5) \n \n \n Magma Cube (big) \n - \n 4 (  ) \n 6 (   ) \n 9 (     ) \n \n \n Magma Cube (small) \n - \n 3 (  ) \n 4 (  ) \n 6 (   ) \n \n \n Magma Cube (tiny) \n - \n 2 (  ) \n 3 (  ) \n 4 (  ) \n \n \n Silverfish \n - \n 1 (  ) \n 1 (  ) \n 1 (  ) \n \n \n Skeleton \'s arrow \n - \n 3 (  ) \n 4 (  ) \n 6 (   ) \n \n \n Slime (big) \n - \n 3 (  ) \n 4 (  ) \n 6 (   ) \n \n \n Slime (small) \n - \n 2 (  ) \n 2 (  ) \n 3 (  ) \n \n \n Slime (tiny) \n - \n 0 (  ) \n 0 (  ) \n 0 (  ) \n \n \n Spider \n - \n 2 (  ) \n 2 (  ) \n 3 (  ) \n \n \n Wolf (tamed) \n - \n 3 (  ) \n 4 (  ) \n 6 (   ) \n \n \n Wolf (hostile) \n - \n 2 (  ) \n 2 (  ) \n 3 (  ) \n \n \n Zombie \n - \n 2 (  ) - 4 (  ) \n 3 (  ) - 6 (   ) \n 4 (  ) - 9 (     ) \n \n \n Zombie Pigman \n - \n 5 (   ) \n 9 (     ) \n 13 (      ) \n \n \n [ edit ] Knockback \n When receiving damage from a hostile mob you will also be knocked back. The resulting disorientation and loss of control should not be underestimated, as it is possible to be knocked back over a cliff or into lava, both of which are potentially fatal. \n Players can also be nudged by neutral mobs walking into them, but note that this effect was removed in the 1.3.2 update. The push is not nearly as powerful as a hostile mob\'s knockback, but can still send the player off of a cliff or into lava , or fall off a cliff into lava . Knockback can also be caused when a player throws a chicken egg or a snowball at a mob, useful for making traps. As of Beta 1.8, sprinting while attacking a mob causes extra knockback. Players/Mobs riding an entity (typically a boat , a minecart or a pig ) never receive any knockback when attacked. \n [ edit ] Natural damage \n Besides mobs, players can take damage from several other events in Minecraft. \n [ edit ] Lightning damage \n As of Minecraft 1.0.0, Lightning will do two 2 (  ) damage, even through armor. Lightning strikes on the player are very rare, and only occur during thunderstorms. It is most likely that when the player gets hit by lightning they will be set on Fire , but fires and flaming mobs are very quickly put out from the rain during a thunderstorm. \n [ edit ] Fall damage \n You receive damage when falling from excessive height. Armor does not reduce fall damage, unless it is enchanted with Feather Falling or Protection. Fall damage is 1 point for each block fallen after the third. Thus falling 4 blocks causes  damage. From 5 blocks,  damage. From 6 blocks,   points are lost and so forth. Assuming full health but no enchanted armor, a 23 block fall will be fatal (23 - 3 = 20 damage = 10 hearts of damage). \n Mobs (other than chickens, ghasts, snow golems, blazes, magma cubes, iron golems, ocelots, bats and, presumably, the ender dragon and wither) suffer fall damage as well. \n In some cases, it is possible to avoid falling or otherwise survive a fall. Falling damage is only dealt after a height of three blocks. \n \n Sneaking (default \xe2\x87\xa7 Left Shift ) will prevent you from falling off most blocks. \n Landing in water will prevent you from taking fall damage. \n Moving into a Ladder or Vine \'s area of effect during free fall will reduce vertical velocity to normal ladder descent speed and no damage will be taken. \n Moving into water during free fall will also reduce velocity. \n It is dangerous, but sometimes useful, to descend cliffs by walking off a cliff while in a boat. Exit the boat before impact, and you will only take damage for the distance fallen since exiting the boat. \n Jumping counts as falling for 1.5 blocks, therefore adding  to your total fall damage, so keep this in mind when trying to avoid fall damage. \n If falling next to a wall, emptying a bucket of water against the wall a few blocks from the ground can often save your life. \n Wearing armor that is enchanted with feather falling or protection reduces fall damage based on the level of the enchantment. \n Throwing an Ender Pearl and teleporting will reset your velocity, and you will only take damage from the pearl (   ). This works better if you throw the Ender Pearl directly at the ground below you to guarantee the pearl hits the ground before you do. \n Falling into a spider web prevents all fall damage. (Test have been taken by jumping down a tower taller than 20 blocks into a one block thick layer of spider web.) If you place a spider web block beneath you fast enough while approaching the ground you can survive. \n \n (Note- These do apply for the xbox edition too test have been taken) \n [ edit ] Drowning \n \n \n \n  \nThe oxygen bar. \n \n \n When a player runs out of air underwater, they will start drowning and will take approximately 2 (  ) /sec. Mobs can drown as well, though they usually do not, as all mobs (besides iron golems and slimes) attempt to swim upward when in water. \n While mining, consider keeping at least one placeable solid block ready somewhere on your toolbar (such as Dirt or Cobblestone ) for quick access. If you mine into a spring (or worse, the ocean), you should be able to place the block in the hole to prevent drowning. \n If you place a torch on a vertical surface next to you at head height whilst underwater, you create an air bubble which lasts for the split second it takes the water to destroy the torch, thus refilling your oxygen meter without resurfacing. Ladders , signs , fences , trapdoors , doors and sugar cane can create permanent air bubbles underwater. You can also scoop up some water with a bucket to achieve the same effect, or destroy the block directly above you, if there is one. \n [ edit ] Suffocation \n Suffocation happens when a player or a mob is unable to breathe because its upper half is inside of a block . They will lose 1 (  ) every half-second. Due to sand and gravel falling, it can easily cover the player. In first person mode, the player\'s screen will be blackened when suffering from this condition thus disabling them to see what is happening. In third person mode , the view will automatically switch to first person mode. \n When inside a block, the player can easily step out of it as the blocks do not prevent their movement. \n The usual ways to get one\'s head inside a block are: \n \n Sand or Gravel falling into the space the player or mob occupies. \n Riding a Boat or Minecart into a one-block-high space. \n Riding a Horse into a three-block-high space. \n Riding a pig into a two- or one-block-high space. \n Standing where a tree just grew from a sapling . \n Standing where a huge mushroom just grew from a mushroom . \n Standing where an Exit Portal just spawned after killing an Ender Dragon . \n Having a block pushed onto your head with a Piston . \n Throwing an Ender Pearl into a one block space. \n Sleeping in a bed that is surrounded by blocks. \n Being teleported into a block via command blocks or console commands . \n \n \nIt\'s worth noting that the player will not suffocate in glass , or indeed in any transparent block. Leaves from a grown Sapling will not suffocate you, even if you\'re on Fast graphics (which makes leaves appear solid). \n [ edit ] Starvation \n When the food bar reaches zero, the player will take 1 (  ) damage every four seconds. The player stops taking starvation damage when the player eats or the health bar drops to 10 (     ) health on easy mode or 1 (  ) health on normal mode. In hard mode, the damage will not stop until the player either dies, or eats something. \n [ edit ] Cactus contact \n Touching cactus will cause a player or mob to take 1 (  ) damage, and rapidly continue taking damage if he or she continues to stand on or next to it. \n [ edit ] Lava \n By far the most dangerous natural occurrence (except for the unlikely case of a player falling into the void), players and mobs will take damage from contact with Lava extremely fast (   per hit), and stay on fire even if they exit it (  point per hit for 15 hits (       total damage) or until extinguished with water). If players do not have a water source available, they will die quickly. \n While mining, consider keeping at least one placeable solid block ready somewhere on your toolbar (such as Dirt or Cobblestone ) for quick access using your mouse wheel. If you mine into a lava pool, you may be able to place the block in the hole and so prevent burning. It is possible to keep a fire-resistance potion at all times so you can prevent from dying in lava, although if you fall in the lava, you won\'t be able to use the potion in time. Instead, try using a splash potion of fire-resistance. \n [ edit ] Poison \n         \n Cave Spiders will poison players when they bite (only in normal and hard difficulty). Eating a Spider Eye , Poisonous Potato , or drinking/being hit by a potion of poison will give the same result. While poisoned, the hearts in the health meter turn from red to an olive yellow and continually damages the player by 1 (  ) per second until the poison wears off. The poison itself cannot kill the player, but it can always reduce them to 1 hit point, thus leaving them very vulnerable to damage from other sources. Poison can be cured by drinking milk from a bucket. \n [ edit ] The Void \n \n Main article: The Void \n \n If one were to break through the bedrock barrier found at the bottom of worlds, the Void can be seen. Players in the Void, below height -64 will take damage at a rate of about 4 (  ) per half-second. You will usually die from falling in the Void, even in Creative mode , but the player may be saved by throwing an Ender Pearl before they fall to height -64. \n \nFalling into the void in The End is more likely, so players must be cautious when entering The End . \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Indev \n \n \n \n Before suffocation was implemented, players that were covered by blocks could see through dirt and stone . Suffocation was added after Notch discovered that players were abusing this exploit to find underground caves and hollowed carvings. The patch added suffocation damage and made the player unable to see anything when experiencing it. However, this glitch is not completely fixed and is still possible to perform even in the current version of the game. \n \n \n In Survival mode, eating a Red Mushroom would deal the player   of damage because they were poisonous. \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.0.4 \n Players no longer suffocate when riding in a minecart . \n \n \n All of Alpha \n There was a rare bug where in certain worlds players do not take damage. This is only in single player survival mode. Players would not take damage even with all armor off, making the game much too easy. [ citation&#160;needed ] \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.5 \n Unarmed damage was increased from  to  . \n \n \n 1.8 \n Unarmed damage was decreased from  to  . \n \n \n The critical hit feature was implemented in the Adventure Update along with sprinting and blocking as an improvement to the combat system. \n \n \n Hunger added, which deals damage if your hunger is at 0. Also meaning you do not have to eat food to regain your health. \n \n \n Poison added, which deals damage. \n \n \n 1.9pre1 \n Armor no longer prevents certain types of damage. \n \n \n 1.9pre3 \n Sword damage was decreased (a diamond sword dealt 5 hearts before 1.9pre3 and 3.5 hearts after). \n \n \n 1.9pre4 \n Enchantments added, some of which increase damage you deal or decrease damage dealt to you. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.0.0 \n The sound of the player taking damage was changed from a masculine "OOF! or UGHH!" sound, to a painful sounding crunch. These were changed to remove the restriction that all avatars have a male voice, regardless of the gender of the character depicted in the skin. \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w25a \n Removed the downwards knockback while drowning. \n \n \n 12w30a \n Explosions damage the player different amounts in different difficulties, and the player doesn\'t take any damage from explosions on Peaceful. \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w32a \n Mobs can hold weapons, making them deal more damage. Also, the crunching noise from 1.0.0 was changed, sounding more like a slap rather than a bone-breaking punch. The fall damage noise was also changed from a crunch to a dull, thumping noise, like something fell on a carpet. \n \n \n 12w34a \n Wither effect added, which deals damage. \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n Critical hits can be done while reflecting a Ghast \'s fireball, but won\'t change the damage or speed of it. \n In Creative mode , attacking a mob while flying after having descended will score a critical hit. \n When attacking something with a Melee object (Fists, Swords, etc.), there is a brief cooldown before it can be hurt again. Having a Regeneration IV (4) Potion Effect however, seems to remove the cooldown, as the Player/Mob can be hit more often. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n Health \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Damage&amp;oldid=504044 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Citation needed Gameplay UI  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 10 July 2013, at 22:20. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

When placed on a suitable surface, it adjusts its model in relation to how it is placed on a block , so that it can be made to attach to any side of a block except the bottom side. \n From just one block of wood and eight pieces of coal or charcoal , 32 torches can be made, making them an easily obtainable item. Since the Adventure Update , torches have warmer light when placed. They can also be found naturally in Abandoned Mine Shafts , Strongholds and NPC Villages . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Properties \n 2 Torch placement \n 3 Crafting \n 4 As a crafting ingredient \n 5 Video \n 6 History \n 7 Trivia \n 8 See also \n 9 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Properties \n \n \n \n  \nTorches in various positions on Chiseled Stone Bricks . \n \n \n Torches act as a full block, for the purpose of placing other objects or torches in the same area. Being treated as a block by sand and gravel this prevents them from falling down past a block with a torch on it. Instead, sand and gravel break when they fall on a torch. If they are placed directly above a torch they act as if they were on any other solid material, allowing them to be used as environmental triggers, such as airlocks . To the player, torches act as non-solid blocks, allowing players to pass through torches and place them whilst clipping into the torch. Torches also melt nearby snow and ice , making them useful to keep skylights from being snowed over and lakes from freezing in snow biomes . The torches will however only melt snow and ice from a radius of 2 blocks from the torch. The smoke from a torch extends up 2\xc2\xbd blocks. \n When a torch is placed in water , it will be detached, as if you had destroyed it. The block it was placed in will have no water in it afterwards, unless two adjacent water sources cause a third to be created. This can also be used to regain air while underwater. \n \n [ edit ] Torch placement \n \n \n Block name \n Torch placeable \n \n \n Bedrock \n Yes \n \n \n Obsidian \n Yes \n \n \n Water \n No \n \n \n Brick \n Yes \n \n \n Cobblestone \n Yes \n \n \n Block of Diamond \n Yes \n \n \n Block of Gold \n Yes \n \n \n Block of Iron \n Yes \n \n \n Jukebox \n Yes* \n \n \n Moss Stone \n Yes \n \n \n Cobblestone Stairs \n No \n \n \n Double Slab \n Yes \n \n \n Single Slab \n No \n \n \n Stone \n Yes \n \n \n Iron Door \n No \n \n \n Monster Spawner \n Yes \n \n \n Furnace \n Yes* \n \n \n Coal Ore \n Yes \n \n \n Diamond Ore \n Yes \n \n \n Wooden Door \n No \n \n \n Fence \n Yes** \n \n \n Gold Ore \n Yes \n \n \n Torch \n No \n \n \n \n \n Block name \n Torch placeable \n \n \n Iron Ore \n Yes \n \n \n Redstone Ore \n Yes \n \n \n Wooden Stairs \n No \n \n \n Wood Planks \n Yes \n \n \n Chest \n Yes* \n \n \n Ender Chest \n Yes* \n \n \n Crafting Table \n Yes* \n \n \n Wood \n Yes \n \n \n Bookshelf \n Yes \n \n \n Jack-O-Lantern \n Yes \n \n \n Pumpkin \n Yes \n \n \n Melon \n Yes \n \n \n Sign Post \n No \n \n \n Wall Sign \n No \n \n \n Wool \n Yes \n \n \n Rails \n No \n \n \n Clay \n Yes \n \n \n Farmland \n No \n \n \n Grass \n Yes \n \n \n Gravel \n Yes \n \n \n Sponge \n Yes \n \n \n Dirt \n Yes \n \n \n Ice \n No \n \n \n Lever \n No \n \n \n Pressure Plates \n No \n \n \n Sand \n Yes \n \n \n \n \n Block name \n Torch placeable \n \n \n Soul Sand \n Yes \n \n \n Stone Button \n No \n \n \n Cactus \n No \n \n \n Ladders \n No \n \n \n Netherrack \n Yes \n \n \n Glass \n Yes** \n \n \n Glowstone \n No \n \n \n Leaves \n No \n \n \n Snow Block \n Yes \n \n \n Snow \n No \n \n \n Crops \n No \n \n \n Red rose \n No \n \n \n Yellow flower \n No \n \n \n Fire \n No \n \n \n Lava \n No \n \n \n Brown Mushroom \n No \n \n \n Red Mushroom \n No \n \n \n Portal \n No \n \n \n Redstone Wire \n No \n \n \n Redstone Torch \n No \n \n \n Sugar Cane \n No \n \n \n Sapling \n No \n \n \n TNT \n No \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nTorches on a chest. \n \n \n * Torches may be placed on the sides of openable blocks such as chests by holding shift and right-clicking on the block. \n ** Torches may only be placed on the top of fences or glass, not on the sides. \n \n [ edit ] Crafting \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Stick + \n Coal / Charcoal \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n  4  \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] As a crafting ingredient \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Pumpkin + Torch \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Indev \n \n \n 0.31 (29 January 2010) \n Torches added.

[2] They would need to be relit with flint and steel . The permanent torch would be replaced with lanterns , and all torches that exist already in saved games whether placed, stored or in inventory would become lanterns. This was supposed to take effect on October, 31 st 2010 with the Halloween Update , but it does not appear this will be the case anymore. [3] \n If you jump on a placed torch, you will hear a sound of stepping on a wooden block. This is only the sound effect however, so you will not actually stand on it. You must also be moving in a horizontal direction as well, so running and jumping on them is the way to check it. \n It would take 1.26018466 \xc3\x97 10 14 torches to light the entire surface of a minecraft map. It would take approximately double that number to cover everything in a minecraft map, caves and all, counting the 12 million blocks as the edge of the map. \n If a block falls onto a torch (sand or gravel), it breaks the block and gives the player the resource, but the gravel will not drop flint . However, if the torch is placed quickly enough after removing the base of a stack of falling blocks, the stack remains in place. \n Because torches emit a light level of 14 and hostile mobs require a light level of 7 or less to spawn, separating them by up to 12 blocks (i.e., 11 empty blocks between torches) will prevent hostile mobs from spawning. Light does not travel diagonally (see: Taxicab Geometry ), so a torch at point (0,0,0) will supply a light level of 8 to point (3,2,1). \n Torches, interestingly, are created when the Ender Dragon is defeated. \n Breaking a torch with any tool does not decrease its Item durability . \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Redstone Torch \n Redstone Lamp \n Lantern \n Light \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpmK7rDU5bA#t=4m13s \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://notch.tumblr.com/post/1243370641 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://twitter.com/notch/status/22743846228070400 \n \n \n \n Blocks [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Blocks/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Torch&amp;oldid=491021 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Category : Blocks  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 6 June 2013, at 21:57. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

It displays the item or block that is inside it. Players can place items in the frame by right-clicking while holding the item. The displayed item can be rotated by right-clicking the frame. [1] Maps show their contents, and compasses and clocks work as normal. [2] [3] When broken, the frame drops both itself and the item it contains. Because item frames are technically entities like paintings , they can be broken in Adventure Mode . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Crafting \n 2 Uses \n 3 History \n 4 Bugs \n 5 Gallery \n 6 Trivia \n 7 See also \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Crafting \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Sticks + Leather \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n   \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Uses \n Item frames have many uses, [4] and can be placed on cactus blocks, pressure plates , fences , Trees , slabs and cobblestone walls , along with all solid blocks . The player can place items into item frames by right-clicking with the held item in hand. \n The player can use item frames to hold items for convenient retrieval or reference, instead of having to open a chest or dispenser to retrieve specific items. This means item frames can be used to label chests , dispensers , etc. This also allows working clocks and compasses , as well as maps , to be displayed against a wall. A map put into an item frame will show markers at any other item frames with maps in them. This is a good way to mark certain areas. \n Item Frames also have the ability, as well as paintings and signs, to be placed on objects such as chests or doors by holding down the sneak button. \n A Book and Quill can be placed inside an item frame and will store all writing inside the book. This feature makes the item frame useful as it saves chest space and creates a nice image. \n Item frames can be used to display crafting and brewing recipes, and can also be used to hold fire , allowing for safer fireplaces, however, it is not possible to obtain a fire block without using cheats or mods. \n Since items in the frame can be rotated, this allows for directional pointing using items that are shaped like pointers or wedges - such as arrows , tripwire hooks , flower pots , redstone , etc. \n Since levers , torches , and buttons can be placed before the item frame is placed, this allows for color-coded levers (using colored wool on the frame), decorative torch holders (using slabs , anvils , or trapdoors ), and decorative gold trims for buttons (using an item frame inside the item frame). Item frames can be used similarly as signs , allowing for decorative armrests for chairs. \n Item frames can be placed against piston heads to make better-looking frames. \n In Creative mode, items can be cloned by placing multiple copies of the same item in different frames. This is a handy way to clone enchanted weaponry or tools although items can only be retrieved in Survival mode or simply by destroying the block the frame is hanging on in Creative mode. It is also possible in Creative mode to place multiple item frames on the same block after restarting the save. This allows the player to stack items in the "same" frame by placing an item in the frame, saving/quitting to the main menu, and restarting the save. After restarting, it is possible to place another item frame on the same block as the existing one, and the player can then place another item in the new item frame (the first item cannot be rotated after restarting the save). This can be repeated multiple times unless the entity limit is reached. Recently in the new Xbox 360 update, it has allowed to craft an item frame. \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 16 August, 2012 \n Dinnerbone tweeted the first image of item frames. They had a different texture. \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w34a \n Item frames added. There is a bug where attempting to place an item frame in multiplayer causes an internal server error, as well as other bugs. \n \n \n 12w34b \n Previously stated bug fixed. \n \n \n 12w38a \n Item frames no longer despawn when the player moves 20 blocks away. \n \n \n [ edit ] Bugs \n \n If the block an item frame is placed on is moved by a piston , the frame will not move. However, the frame will break upon walking into it. \n If you put more than one item in it and mine the frame you will get only one of the items back. \n If you have an item frame on your field of view, mobs will sink through wooden planks (but not wooden slabs). \n When more than one item frame is filled with the same map, only the first map is marked on by a green marker, as opposed to both of them (may be intentional). \n You can place multiple item frames in the same space by right clicking the space around the frame on the same block. \n You can put an item frame on top of any non-solid block (such as a lever or brewing stand) and they will overlap. The collision box of the item frame overrides that of the original block, so items like buttons with small boxes will be completely hidden behind the item frames making the button unusable. \n If you place the snow tile in the frame it will appear placed flat halfway through the frame. \n Blocks that have frames on them are unaffected by fire \n Fences placed below item frames break the item frame. An item frame can not be placed above a fence. Since the item frame is an entity, the fence is treated as jutting into the item frame, since it is actually one and a half blocks tall. \n In multiplayer survival mode, it is possible to duplicate items with the item frame. Enchanted items can be cloned and will regain use and retain enchantments. This may not apply to all items. \n Items rotated in the frame become darker. \n When shot with a bow, an item frame will disappear, taking the arrow with it. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dinnerbone\'s first screenshot showing armor and weapons \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dinnerbone\'s second screenshot showing a map and a compass \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dinnerbone\'s third screenshot showing a golden sword in all directions, the item frame item itself, and a working clock \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Jeb\'s screenshot of the item frame \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Dinnerbone\'s fourth screenshot, showing flower pots and item frames \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Snapshot image \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n An item frame at the side of a slab \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Four item frames in a one block space \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The frame itself appears to use the texture of the birch wooden planks \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n An image of a fireplace retweeted by Dinnerbone [5] \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n The item frame is based upon a suggestion on Reddit, like the Ender chest and flower pot . [6] \n Item frames can occupy the same block as water without popping off. \n Items also protrude from an item frame, although this is only one pixel, rather than the eight a normal block would do. \n Placing or removing an item frame does not cause a block update. This is because it is an entity, not a block. \n When you place a block inside the frame, It is displayed in miniature half in, half out of the block. This can be most notably seen on stairs or half slabs. \n Light-producing blocks such as Glowstone , Lava and Fire provide no illumination when placed into an Item Frame. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Painting \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n dinnerbonetweet:235742974271700993 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n dinnerbonetweet:235749460800573441 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n dinnerbonetweet:235748062939717632 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdC6OD9laf0 Many Uses of Item Frames \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n http://twitter.com/Dinnerbone/status/238696847496052736 \n \n \xe2\x86\x91 \n dinnerbonetweet:235747041286975488 \n \n \n \n Items [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Items/content \n \n \n \n \n Entities [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Entities/content \n \n \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Item_Frame&amp;oldid=500409 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Category : Decorations  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 2 July 2013, at 17:52. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

The health and hunger bars, as well as the hotbar, are visible. \n \n \n  This article is about the game mode. For other uses, see Survival (disambiguation) . \n Survival mode is the game mode of Minecraft in which players must collect resources, build structures, battle mobs , maintain hunger , and explore the land in an effort to survive. \n In Survival, players have an inventory in which they may gather items . These items may be combined using certain recipes to create tools and other items. This process is known as crafting . Most crafting recipes need a crafting table . Players are also able to create potions by brewing . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Survival single player (SSP) \n \n 1.1 Aim of the game \n \n \n 2 Survival multiplayer (SMP) \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Bugs \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ]  Survival single player (SSP) \n Survival single player is the original game mode of Minecraft . Until mid-Alpha, SSP was the only available mode besides Classic creative mode. SSP may be played online or offline, as long as the user has initially played it while connected to the Internet (which allows game files to download to their computer). \n [ edit ] Aim of the game \n Despite being marketed as a game with no pre-determined goals, Minecraft does offer a proper ending when played in Survival mode by defeating the Ender Dragon . However when you reach The Nether the player has the option of: 1. Finding a Nether Fortress and using Wither Skeleton heads to create a Wither , or 2. Making Eyes of Ender and using these to go to The End to defeat the Ender Dragon. Choosing to attempt the Wither boss first proves more rewarding as the player can then make beacons and use them to help defeat overworld mobs - usually via grinders. Although one can take a beacon to fight the dragon, it (along with it\'s support blocks) will be frequently destroyed by the passing dragon. \n \n The player starts in The Overworld where they must learn to survive using the player\'s intuition. \n The player must search caves or ravines for specific items to survive their first night. \n The player crafts their first tools which, under most (although not all) circumstances, will be a wooden pickaxe . This is then used to acquire stone tools. \n The player builds a home featuring a bed , chests full of spare materials, a crafting table , and a furnace . \n The player successfully finds a cave, canyon, or large underground opening which contains large deposits of usable minerals. \n The player finds and smelts iron ore into iron ingots and uses it for tools, or, if they acquire enough, possibly (but not necessarily) armor . \n The player strikes diamonds ! While looking for diamonds it is important the player keep a level head as to their surroundings, for in large caves there are usually many enemy mobs that can hunt down the player, so a few swords , a full set of armor and many torches are usually necessary. \n The player mines some obsidian . If not found, obsidian can be created by crafting a bucket , filling it with water , and pouring it into stationary lava . \n The player builds a portal to The Nether with the newly acquired obsidian. \n The player appears in the dimension The Nether; a new world bereft of minerals which poses new, scary threats to the player: Zombie Pigmen , Magma Cubes , Ghasts , Blazes , and Wither Skeletons . \n The player finds a Nether Fortress and finds the blaze spawner and attacks the Blazes, killing them and collecting their Blaze Rods from their defeat for use in potion brewing and to access the last challenge. \n The player navigates safely and successfully through The Nether and returns to The Overworld where their job is to find Endermen and kill them to obtain their Ender Pearls . \n The player constructs a peculiar item with unusual ghostly properties called an Eye of Ender , which when thrown will direct the player to the Stronghold they must go and find. \n Twelve Eyes of Ender must be kept with you when you find the Stronghold . This is important. \n Once the player finds the portal and the player has put the 12 Eyes of Ender in place, the portal into The End will open and you will now meet your destiny. \n Once their most worthy adversary, the legendary Ender Dragon , has been beaten, a story will scroll and credits will roll and then, and only then, the player will be teleported to their spawn location. (You can press ESC if you want to skip the story and credits, but read the story.) \n After you beat the game, you can explore the world, make a mineshaft underground, enlarge your house, defeat enemy mobs, and eat porkchops to your ever-growing imagination in the world of Minecraft . \n An optional thing to do is to kill the Wither to make a beacon so you can have some perks in a distance. \n \n [ edit ]  Survival multiplayer (SMP) \n \n See also: Multiplayer \n \n Survival multiplayer is played by users who connect to a central Minecraft server . This enables them to interact with other users. \n The command to toggle a player\'s game mode (survival, adventure or creative) in multiplayer (must be operator in order to use this command) is: \n \n/gamemode [0/1/2] [player\'s name]\n \n (0 for survival, 1 for creative, 2 for adventure) \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n This game mode was introduced on 4 th of August, 2009 in Survival Test under Classic . During this time, players experienced permadeath, meaning they could not respawn and the level needed to be restarted unless a save file had been created. \n The inventory and crafting was only introduced in the Indev version while the Infdev version features infinite map generation. This version also drops the permadeath feature allowing the player to respawn . The Alpha version improved the map generation by introducing biomes . \n The Multiplayer variant of this game mode also took place in the Alpha version. Originally, Notch had only allowed a limited number of people from the Minecraft IRC channel to participate in the first tests of SMP. These invitees could invite other people to test out this mode; however the password was leaked and the server was quickly filled up. Notch released the first version of the SMP server software on the 4th of August, 2010. The client was updated so that players could enter the IP of a server to join it. \n As of version 1.3, SSP was abolished in a technical sense. Instead, the player hosts a server that they can either close or open to others at any time. This change was intended to reduce the labor required to fix bugs for two different parts of Minecraft, at a slight performance cost. \n [ edit ] Bugs \n \n Main article: Known bugs \n \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Survival&amp;oldid=499230 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Gameplay Game modes  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 30 June 2013, at 06:40. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

When eaten, a golden carrot restores 6 hunger points, and 14.4 saturation points (the highest saturation of any food currently in the game). A golden carrot is required to brew the Potion of Night Vision , and is thereby vital in creating the coveted Potion of Invisibility (which requires a Night Vision potion as an ingredient.) It is also used to breed horse, donkeys, and mules. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Crafting \n 2 As a brewing ingredient \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Trivia \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Crafting \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Carrot + \n Gold Nuggets \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n   \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] As a brewing ingredient \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Golden Carrot \n+ \n Awkward Potion \n= \n Potion of Night Vision \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w34a \n Added golden carrots. \n \n \n 12w36a \n Texture changed from  to  due to suggestions that the texture was suggestive. \n \n \n 12w37a \n Texture changed from  to  in order to match the new carrot texture. The item sprite no longer has a dark outline. \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n A stack of 64 Carrots will equal 512 Gold nuggets or 6 Blocks, 2 Ingots, and 8 Nuggets. \n Golden carrots being used for potions of night vision is based on the common misconception that eating carrots can improve one\'s vision; this is only true if one has vitamin A deficiency. \n Golden carrots may be the most beneficial (magical effects excluding) food item so far: their effective food+saturation value is 20.4 - just a bit less than that of meat (20.8), and they are 1.5 times as nourishing, meaning you\'ll spend a greater fraction of time in saturated state with health regeneration on. Nonetheless, they require nearly a full gold ingot\'s worth of gold nuggets in order to be created, and with gold being quite a rare material, it may be better to save this item for potions of invisibility and night vision. \n \n \n \n Items [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Items/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Golden_Carrot&amp;oldid=503350 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Category : Food  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 9 July 2013, at 14:57. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

There are two separate versions of Creative mode, one only available in the full game, whilst the other, Classic Creative mode, is available for free on the game\'s main website. Creative mode strips away the survival aspects of Minecraft and allows players to easily create and destroy structures. \n Creative mode allows players to destroy all blocks instantly (including normally-indestructible blocks such as bedrock ) and the ability to fly . Players are given an infinite number of blocks to build with and no health bar thus rendering the player immune to all damage. The only possible ways to die without the use of external tools are to use the /kill command, or to fall into the Void . Taking advantage of this, players can create large constructions more easily. Creative mode is also often used in mini-sports, such as Spleef . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Gameplay \n \n 1.1 Representation in level.dat \n 1.2 Missing blocks and items \n \n \n 2 Classic Creative \n 3 Video \n 4 History \n 5 Bugs \n 6 See also \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Gameplay \n Once a singleplayer Creative mode level is created, if cheats are enabled, it can be changed to a Survival world (or vice-versa) with the /gamemode &lt;0/1&gt; command. In multiplayer , players can be individually changed between Creative and Survival mode and even adventure mode with the /gamemode &lt;0/1&gt; &lt;player&gt; command available to operators . 0 signifies Survival, 1 is Creative, and 2 is Adventure (works only on vanilla server). This means that individual players can play Creative mode (at the operator\'s discretion) on a Survival map, or vice-versa. The game mode can also be changed by typing /gamemode creative for Creative mode, /gamemode survival for Survival etc. \n \n \n \n  \nThe Creative mode inventory showing the search tab for the PC version. \n \n \n In Creative, the normal inventory screen is replaced by the item selection screen , which contains almost all blocks and items in a tabbed interface. There is also a search feature. One tab provides a Survival-like inventory, including armor slots. Some items behave differently than in Survival mode; for example, empty buckets will never fill with water or lava , and water and lava buckets never empty, no matter how many times they are used. \n Dropped items can be picked up by the player, but if the hotbar is already full, the items will go in the Survival inventory. \n Flying is enabled, activated by double tapping Space then single pressing Space to go up and \xe2\x87\xa7 Shift to go down and the W A S D keys (default) to move. The player can disable flying in mid-air by double-tapping Space again, causing them to drop to the ground. Touching the ground when flying also disables flying. However, getting into a minecart or bed while flying will not disable flying when the player gets out. \n Flying very close to the top of a block without touching it will generate footsteps sounds. As flying is much faster than walking, it will generate a lot of footsteps at once. It is also possible to hear wood footstep sounds when hovering right over some non-solid blocks like torches or signs . \n The player can obtain items using the pick block key by pressing middle-click (by default). This lets players obtain many other blocks that are not in the item select menu, items like Nether portal , monster spawner , End portal , and the dragon egg . In SMP , any item not in the Creative inventory, including both the items above and enchanted items, will briefly appear in the Creative inventory upon being placed in the player\'s regular inventory, allowing players to duplicate enchanted items. It is an easy way to make a magical kindom or an amazing game. \n Mobs will still spawn like in Survival (including from monster spawners), but are neutral and will not try to attack the player unless provoked. Even then they will do no damage. Creepers are still a hazard, as they might explode near structures (Not the case as of 1.6 ). \n Normally indestructible blocks like bedrock and end portal frameblocks can also be destroyed. Going too far into the Void will still kill the player, but the player can fly around in the Void provided they do not descend below the y coordinate of -64. This, along with the /kill command, is the only way to die in Creative mode without using 3rd party editors. If typing anything after /kill won\'t affect the command. \n Blocks that are destroyed by means other than clicking on them (destroying a block it is attached to) can still be picked up. However, paintings , minecarts, powered minecarts and storage minecarts can be picked up when destroyed by punching. \n If the player flies very high above the clouds , it will seem as if there are two suns , when in fact, both the sun and the moon are visible. This is due to the game\'s limited render distance; changing it will only increase/decrease the height needed to see this. \n Some items and blocks are only available in Creative mode, such as sponges and spawn eggs . \n In Xbox 360 Edition , creating a new Creative Mode world or opening an existing world in Creative Mode will permanently disable Achievements and Leaderboard updates for that particular game, but have no other effects on gameplay. In other words, Achievements and Leaderboard only work in games that have always been in Survival mode. \n [ edit ] Representation in level.dat \n To change the GameType in the level.dat it has to be opened with something like NBTedit: \n As of 1.2.1, the code is now different. You\'ll find the String "GameType" in clear text followed by 0x000000: \n \n Survival: 0\nCreative: 1\nAdventure: 2\n \n \n [ edit ] Missing blocks and items \n There are several in game blocks that do not appear in the item select menu: \n \n Nether Portal block \n Huge Mushroom blocks \n Farmland \n Monster Spawners \n Command Blocks \n Dragon Egg \n Fireworks \n \n Note: Using pick block on these blocks doesn\'t give them except Command Block (using it on Huge Mushroom blocks give the respective small mushroom, farmland gives dirt, using pick block on portal block, Mob spawner and Dragon Egg does nothing). However, they can be obtained with /give command . \n [ edit ] Classic Creative \n \n \n \n This version is outdated. \n However, the game is still available for free, online. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nA village made in Classic Creative \n \n \n Classic Creative can be reached by going to minecraft.net and clicking on the \'singleplayer\' or \'multiplayer\' links. \n For obvious reasons, any blocks added in the full release, Beta , Alpha, Infdev, or Survival Test cannot be accessed. In order to play classic creative multiplayer you must be logged into your Minecraft account. \n Many of the blocks have been retextured since. Many abilities on servers were lost as Creative and Survival became separate. ( /fly , etc.) \n \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n \n This section requires expansion. \n You can help us by expanding it . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe Creative mode item selection screen prior to 12w21b \n \n \n \n \n Classic \n \n \n May 10, 2009 \n From the beginning, Minecraft was a sandbox creative building game. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.8 \n Separate Creative mode released in the Adventure Update . \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w16a \n Cheats allow switching between Survival and Creative modes without mods or editors. \n \n \n 12w21b \n The tabbed inventory window is added; previously, there was a single list of blocks and items, with no access to the survival inventory (except when using crafting tables or similar blocks). \n \n \n 12w22a \n Armor slots, crafting grid, and a delete item feature are added to the survival inventory. \n \n \n Potions are added to the creative inventory. However, the potion of instant health is missing. \n \n \n 1.3.1pre \n The crafting grid was removed from the survival inventory tab because of a duplication bug. \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w38a \n Added Healing and Harming potions to the creative inventory. \n \n \n 1.5 \n 13w09c \n All potions have been categorized in the Brewing menu. \n \n \n 1.6 \n 13w17a \n Added extra tooltip info in the search tab for the creative inventory. \n \n \n 13w18a \n Hostile mobs no longer follow players when hit in Creative mode. \n \n \n 13w25b \n It is no longer possible to break blocks with a sword in Creative mode. \n \n \n 13w26a \n Creepers do not explode when hit in Creative mode. \n \n \n Experience levels no longer appear in Creative mode. Previously, experience would be hidden but experience levels would show. Now, this is no longer the case. \n \n \n [ edit ] Bugs \n \n While in creative mode, it has been noted that sometimes a bug will occur that prevents you from dragging and dropping items in the inventory (items will instantly snap from the hot bar to GUI or back of the inventory). This bug can be quickly fixed by tapping the right shift button. \n While in creative mode, it has been rarely happening that when in the water, it may turn black and when under it looking through glass, everything looks green. This can be fixed by exiting the water and trying again. If none of this works, contact anyone that has to do with the creation of Minecraft. \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Survival \n Hardcore \n Classic \n \n \n Gameplay [ edit ] \n \n \n View at: Template:Gameplay/content \n \n \n \n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Creative&amp;oldid=504450 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Sections to be expanded Gameplay Game modes  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Magyar \n\t\t\t \xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4 \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t Polski \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 12 July 2013, at 01:47. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.

A block update does not fix this, and the torch remains until either it or the fence is destroyed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.3.3 \n August 9, 2012 \n \n 0.3.3 \n Additions: \n \n Hostile mobs\n \n Skeletons \n Spiders \n \n \n Items\n \n Bow and arrow \n Bonemeal \n Flint \n \n \n \n Tweaks: \n \n Item decay time extended to 5 minutes \n 6 slot hotbar for all devices \n Better brightness \n When you fall down from a cliff or at a high place, a sound playing some bones breaking will be heard. \n \n \n \n Bug Fixes: \n \n \n \n \n Fire has been removed. \n Fixed a bug where fire would spread throughout an entire world after a single flammable block had been set aflame by lava . \n Corrected crafting recipes for furnace , Block of Iron , Lapis Lazuli Block , Block of Gold and Block of Diamond . \n Furnace crashing bug has been fixed. \n Sapling/leaves fixes. \n You now need a crafting table to make doors. \n Torches can now be placed on fences. \n Dandelion Yellow dye no longer appears as an egg in MATTIS or the hotbar \n A bug where cactus and door placed next to each other would remove the bottom door block (and top one if a 2 level cactus). \n Removed particles from spawning when you hit the edges of the world. \n Stairs now block light. \n Some sounds that are missing can now be heard: cow hurt sound, the sound when you break glass/ice. \n A bug where fence gate would not appear in the user\xe2\x80\x99s hand but in the world. \n When a user stood on a slab and created another one, the user simply fell through. \n Swords (and other tools) now take damage from hitting mobs. \n Golden tools are no longer tougher than wooden tools. \n The rear end texture where upside down on some animals. \n The D-pad on iPad no longer/rarely intersects with the item slots. \n Users can no longer place sugar cane in water. \n Dark green leaves have correct textures when cut by shear. \n Blocks placed on snow aren\xe2\x80\x99t duplicated in multiplayer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bugs: \n \n \n \n \n Torch lighting not as effective. \n Bows don\'t lose durability. \n Sometimes when holding a bow, it shows the bow and the arrow. \n When aiming using a bow in third person mode, the bow is above the hand. \n Some sounds are missing: Spider\'s death sound, etc. \n While drawing back an arrow if the user aims at a torch, sapling, flower, sugar cane, or mushroom it is broken. [16] \n Dandelion Yellow and Bone Meal sometimes appear as green dye in hand and also in third person mode. \n Hostile Mobs don\'t have the correct health (for example, Zombies now take up to 2 hits with a Diamond Sword .) \n Sometimes when aiming with a bow, Minecraft PE crashes and some of your stuff in furnace will be deleted. \n The animation for drawing back the bow has gaps in between the pixels. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.3.2 \n July 16, 2012 \n \n 0.3.2 \n Additions: \n \n Furnaces \n \n Every available block and item can now be gathered, crafted or smelted into. (no more unlimited items) \n \n \n Saplings \n Glass Panes \n Slabs in different materials \n Gold Ingots \n Gold Ore \n Gold tools \n Block of Gold \n Iron Ingots \n Iron tools \n Block of Iron \n Diamonds \n Diamond Ore \n Diamond tools \n Block of Diamond \n \n \n \n Bug Fixes: \n \n \n \n \n Less flickering/Z-fighting on some devices. \n If you have 1 sword, or an item or block, the "1" will never show up again \n Mobs have correct health. \n Fixed rendering of fence gate and half block in hand. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bugs: \n \n \n \n \n Saplings aren\'t available in Creative. \n Saplings aren\'t visible in the hotbar. \n Dandelion Yellow is shown as an egg (and vice versa) in MATTIS and the hotbar \n Swords don\'t loss durability when hitting mobs. \n Crafting an iron block only needs 6 iron ingots, but an iron block yields 9 iron ingots \n Crafting a Wooden Door only requires 4 Wooden Planks. \n Crafting Stairs only require 3 of the required material, but generates only one Wooden Stair (i.e. 3 Wooden Planks for 1 Staircase). \n Furnaces and Ladders require 5 Cobblestone and 5 Sticks (respectively). \n Short clicking a furnace crashes the client in (MP)Creative. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.3.0 (Android) \n April 24, 2012 \n \n Still Called 0.3.0 in the changelog \n \n Fixed Icons Bug \n More inventory space \n Smaller GUI \n \n \n \n \n 0.3.0 \n April 24, 2012 \n \n 0.3.0 \n Additions: \n \n Crafting - Minecraft Advanced Touch Technology Interface System (MATTIS) crafting system \n Mobs\n \n Cows \n Chickens \n \n \n New sounds \n New inventory \n Blocks\n \n Crafting Table \n Iron Ore (obtainable, but invisible in inventory) \n Brick Slabs \n Brick Stairs \n Cobblestone Slabs \n Wooden Slabs \n \n \n Items\n \n Snow \n Sticks \n Dandelion Yellow \n Bowls \n Sugar \n Books \n Paper \n Coal \n \n \n Tools\n \n Wooden Axe \n Wooden Shovel \n Wooden Pickaxe \n Wooden Sword \n \n \n Added bookshelves to Survival Mode \n \n Tweaks: \n \n All items need to be gathered, except Shears , Bricks &amp; Glass \n Cameras are now obtainable via inventory editor. \n \n \n \n Bugs: \n \n \n \n \n When bookshelves are destroyed they drop 3 bookshelves instead of 3 books . \n The items have wrong images. \n Game force closes upon opening on some devices. \n All items are craftable, with or without a crafting table . (Tested on Xperia Play only) \n Game Restarts the Device upon opening on Some devices. (Tested Xperia play) \n When trying to craft brick slabs or brick stairs , the game thinks you have one brick, not infinite. \n There are two torch recipes for crafting, however one requires charcoal and is unusable. \n With wooden slabs , the dropped icon and the icon in your hand is a stone slab . \n If you have 1 sand, or a different block or item, a "1" will be next to it. \n Despite having no furnace , iron ore can still be mined and dropped. it appears invisible in your inventory but can be placed in your world. \n Leaf blocks have the texture of crafting table sides when held, do not stack, and have a durability bar. \n In Survival Mode, doors cannot be collected when broken. \n Sugar cane drops its item icon in Creative mode, and you can "pick it up". [17] \n If you drop an axe and two different blocks, the axe symbol shows the infinity symbol instead of a number one after picked up. (other items have been tested and yes it is the same as the axe, and the item turns back to a number one once used again) \n You cannot obtain stone slabs in Survival Mode. \n Swords do not lose durability when used on a mob, only when used to break blocks. \n When the limit of blocks is reached, you can still craft it, but it won\'t give you anything. \n When crafting a wooden door it says it requires four wooden planks and can be crafted without a crafting table, but on Minecraft for PC, it uses six wooden planks using crafting table. \n Lava bug, it starts to spread fire all over your world without stopping. Also with lava bug, it allows water to be set on fire.(major bug) [18] \n On rare occasions, charcoal will drop from coal ore instead of the usual coal . This is the only way to use a seemingly unusable torch recipe. \n Cameras are very glitchy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.2.1 alpha2 (Android) \n March 17, 2012 \n \n \n Major bug fix for some tablet devices and smart Phones in which the game was unable to open. \n Acer Iconia Tab A500 fixed \n \n \n \n \n 0.2.1 \n March 14, 2012 \n \n 0.2.1 (Last Lite Version) \n This is the last release for the Lite version of Minecraft Pocket Edition \n Additions: \n \n New controller option \xe2\x80\x93 Split Touch Controls \n \n This option may be more suitable for devices with larger screens. The cross hair is in the right half of the screen. [19] \n \n \n Mobs\n \n Pigs \n \n \n Added bookshelves in Creative mode \n Sugar cane is now infinite (unable to collect them) \n \n Tweaks: \n \n Flying is changed; ascend/descend by sliding from the center button to the up/down button \n Bigger screens have more hotbar icons \n \n \n \n Bug Fixes: \n \n \n \n \n Blocks now have the \'cracking\' animation when you destroy them \n The circle shown when breaking blocks is sharper \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bugs: \n \n \n \n \n Enabling Split Touch mode once makes MCPE crash (without error message) on starting (old or new) world. Even uninstall/install cycle won\'t help. (Acer Iconia) \n When flying above the height limit in third-person, your avatar disappears. \n When underwater, you can\'t see the breaking animation \n In creative, if you\'re playing in multiplayer and they go into lava or underwater and drown, they die. \n In creative mode, flying above the height limit lets you walk on the edge of the world, on top of the block invisible bedrock found in the files of the game. \n Sometimes in multiplayer, if you a put a block, it puts another block on top of the block you just put. \n When someone dies in multiplayer, rarely they will be invisible and zombies will not attack the invisible player. It\'ll be dead by somethin invisible. \n If you host a game, you will suffer from fall damage but others who join will not take damage when fell. Even if you join a game, you would not suffer but the host of the game will die from fall damage. \n The outer circle while you\'re breaking a block (using normal controls, not split touch) usually disappears. \n You can put cacti on any block as long as it has snow on top of it. [20] \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.2.0 (Android) \n February 11, 2012 \n \n Still Called 0.2.0 in the changelog \n \n \n Bug Fixes: \n \n \n \n \n Major bug fix for some phones that crashed while trying to create a new world \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.2.0 \n iOS - February 17, 2012 \n \nAndroid - February 11, 2012 \n \n 0.2.0 \n Survival Update \n \n New Game Modes\n \n Creative (All worlds created before alpha 0.2.0 will be in creative)\n \n You can fly - Press the jump button twice to initiate flight. From there, double press and hold up/down to ascend/descend \n \n \n Survival \n \n Crafting is still not an available feature \n Because of this, stone shovels , stone pickaxes , stone axes , shears , stone swords , ladders , torches , wooden doors , fences , fence gates , wooden planks , Bricks , stone and wooden stairs , stone slabs , and 13 of the 16 colored wool blocks (excluding light gray , magenta , and orange dyes), glass , and leaves are included in survival mode \n The Day-night cycle has been introduced. \n Even though it is Survival , the user can still see the blocks as though s/he were Creative mode, but he cannot use them unless he has gathered some of this material.\n \n This effectively works as the Inventory , but lacks to standard 2x2 crafting grid from the original inventory. \n \n \n Some materials (Tools and anything that can not be naturally acquired) are in infinite stacks which is indicated by \xe2\x88\x9e (infinity) symbols. \n When an item you have 0 of is selected your fist is shown. \n Added Hitpoints Bar same as computer version (health will slowly regenerate, similar to peaceful difficulty in the computer version). \n Added Air Bar when under water (you can now drown and die) \n Added Death with options to respawn or go to main menu. \n Added a day and night cycle with zombies coming out at night. \n When breaking materials, you can gather any material regardless of what tool is used.\n \n For example, you can now break stone with your hand and receive cobblestone , but using a pickaxe is still faster. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n New Mobs \n \n Sheep \n Pig \n Zombie \n \n \n New Blocks \n \n Fence \n Fence Gate \n Wooden Door \n Cactus \n Oak wood is unobtainable and trees now spawn with Dark wood \n \n \n New Tools \n \n Stone Shovel \n Stone Pickaxe \n Stone Axe \n Stone Sword \n Shears \n \n To shear a sheep , you must touch and hold down on the screen, similar to breaking a block. If you do not, you will simply hurt the sheep and eventually kill it (8 hits). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bugs: \n \n \n \n \n When attempting to type in a seed , the virtual keyboard covers up the box you type the seed into and you cannot see what you are typing. \n White wool is unobtainable. \n There is no way to get stone blocks in Survival. \n You can not see the fire when the zombies are burning in the day light. \n You can hit mobs through glass. \n You can not see fence gates when they are selected. \n You can hit mobs through doors when looking through the window part of the door. \n Sugar cane is unobtainable in survival. \n If you place a ladder on a block with a thin snow layer on it and no block behind it, it will be invisible, with its normal hitbox, until a block directly adjacent to it is updated. Then, the ladder will drop as a collectible item (lighting updates via torch do apply). \n When killed by another player, items that weren\'t even obtained by the player will appear (like obsidian, etc.) \n Fences are sometimes invisible when placed close to water \n Block of Iron , Block of Gold , and Block of Diamond are not in the survival mode inventory \n Game crashes when trying to create a new world on some phones. \n Sometimes The forward button doesn\'t work on right handed mode.(Needs Confirmation) \n Sometimes player can\'t pickup items. \n The Trees that grow have a different Wood Block ID (oak) and color than the Wood blocks in your Inventory (pine), thus making it impossible to pick up oak logs. \n Sugar Cane doesn\'t drop when smacked. \n When you break the bottom block of a Cactus it only gives one Cactus block instead of all that were above it as well. \n You cannot place torches on fences. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0.1.3 (iOS) \n December 14, 2011 \n \n 0.1.3 (iOS) \n \n Fixed bug with opening dialogs after closing the options menu \n Improvements in network chunk loading \n Added an "Update game!" block used as placeholder for not yet supported block types \n \n \n \n \n 0.1.3 (Android) \n December 3, 2011 \n \n 0.1.3 (Android) \n \n Better tablet support \n Less oversized ingame UI elements \n Performance improvements, especially in Non-Fancy graphics mode \n Added cacti to deserts \n Added Turn Sensitivity setting \n Improvements in network chunk loading \n More sounds in J-version \n \n \n \n Bug Fixes: \n \n \n \n \n Fixed a crash bug when connecting to some iOS server maps \n Fixed blocks placed on snow were added incorrectly in multiplayer \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bugs: \n \n \n \n \n When the game tries to generate a world the green "bar" will freeze and not generate a world on some phones.

The following help section is created and edited by wiki users, just like the rest of the wiki. \n [ edit ] Experienced with Minecraft, but new to wikis? \n \n A wiki is designed to allow every user to edit its content. If you see something you think could be improved about the Minecraft Wiki, improve it! Just click the "edit" tab at the top of most pages to edit their contents. You may have to create an account or log in before you\'re able to edit pages without your IP Address being displayed in the edit history \xe2\x80\x93 but it\'s free and takes under a minute to do so. \n Don\'t be afraid to edit. Part of the wiki system is an integrated version tracking system, so there\'s never a fear of losing something. If you make a mistake, you or someone else can easily fix it \xe2\x80\x93 so take the initiative and make a change if you think it\'s useful. (Tip: when editing, you can also use the "Preview" button to check how the page will look before you save it!) \n Don\'t worry if you just want to make a small change, though \xe2\x80\x93 go ahead and do it; someone can always update it later for consistency if needed. \n If you need a basic guide to the formatting syntax used for editing pages, take a look at the editing help page . \n If you want to experiment with wiki code someplace other than an actual article page, you can use your own sandbox . \n Once you feel comfortable with wiki syntax, feel free to start adding your Minecraft knowledge to the articles. \n If you are comfortable on making a major edit on a page, but takes several edits to do so, make sure you add the template Template:In use on top of the article before anything else. \n \n [ edit ] Experienced with wikis, but new to Minecraft? \n \n The Minecraft Wiki is designed to be a reference for all things Minecraft-related. Feel free to create articles on topics as you encounter them, and of course to use the Minecraft Wiki as a helpful guide to your Minecraft experience. \n If you\'ve worked with wikis before, then all of the standard formatting will be familiar. \n \n [ edit ] New to everything? \n \n If you\'re looking to find information, the best place to start is either browsing from the main page , using the links in the left sidebar, or using the search box at the top of the page. \n If you don\'t find what you\'re looking for, remember that the Minecraft Wiki is made up of articles contributed by its users \xe2\x80\x93 it might just be that no one has written about that topic yet! So create one ! \n If you want to contribute (perhaps you found a topic that didn\'t have any info when you were looking for it, and now you know more about it), go for it! The Meta-wiki editing help page has the basics of how to use wiki formatting, and you can edit any page just by clicking the "edit" link at the top (you\'ll need to be logged in to see edit links, but creating an account is free and easy!). If you want to create a new page, just type the name in the search box on the left and click Go \xe2\x80\x93 if it doesn\'t exist, you\'ll be given the option to edit it as new. \n If you\'re unsure about something to add, use the talk page.

For player skins, see Skin . \n \n \n \n  \nDefault versus JoliCraft in the center \n \n \n A texture pack was a collection of files that was used to change the in-game textures of blocks , items , mobs and the GUI. They were zip files that had various PNG images in them and a pack.txt. The native resolution of Minecraft\'s textures were 16\xc3\x9716 (measured pixels in block height and width). 32\xc3\x9732, 64\xc3\x9764, 128\xc3\x97128, 256\xc3\x97256 and 512\xc3\x97512 textures were referred to as \'HD.\' Any texture could be animated in 1.5.x. All PC versions of Minecraft prior to 1.6.1 supported custom textures, although old versions ( Alpha 1.2.2 or earlier) required the modification of the minecraft.jar file. Versions prior to 1.5 required a patch/mod, such as MCPatcher or OptiFine, for HD packs and animated textures. Texture packs could be read without being in a .zip file, which allowed the use of the "texture pack reloading" key (which was F3 + T ). \n In 1.6.1, texture packs were succeeded with resource packs . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 History \n \n 1.1 Changes in Minecraft 1.5 \n \n \n 2 Installing a texture pack \n \n 2.1 Installation tips \n \n \n 3 List of texture packs \n \n 3.1 Native resolution (16px) \n 3.2 Low resolution (8px or lower) \n 3.3 High resolution (32px or more) \n \n \n 4 Creating a texture pack \n \n 4.1 Animated textures \n \n 4.1.1 Special cases \n \n \n 4.2 List of modifiable files and folders \n 4.3 Resources \n \n \n 5 Sharing and distributing \n 6 Obsolescence \n 7 Trivia \n 8 Resources \n 9 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Alpha \n \n \n 1.2.2 \n Official support for 16\xc3\x9716 texture packs was added this update. Prior to this update, users would need to manually change the texture packs by overwriting their minecraft.jar files or use a patcher. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.8 \n The HD crash bug is fixed, but they still don\'t work correctly with the unpatched client. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.3 \n 12w23a \n Texture packs in folders (not zipped) are recognized and the texture pack image is displayed (for folders, not zipped). \n \n \n 12w24a \n The texture pack folder button now works on Macs. \n \n \n 1.5 \n 13w02a \n The "terrain.png" and "gui/items.png" files were replaced by individual block and item images, allowing for HD and animated textures. \n \n \n 1.6.1 \n 13w24a \n Texture packs are no longer supported and are replaced with resource packs . \n \n \n [ edit ] Changes in Minecraft 1.5 \n During MineCon 2012 Mojang announced that Minecraft will support HD texture packs and animated texture packs in the Redstone Update . \n Here is a video of the announcement: \n \n \n \n Starting from Minecraft 1.5, or snapshot 13w02a specifically, the "terrain.png" and "gui/items.png" files were replaced by individual block and item images (sheet images). These individual images are "stitched" together again at runtime, which will make sure that the default artwork is used if images are missing in the selected texture pack. \n The game also no longer creates procedural textures for fire, lava, water, portals, clocks or compasses. Instead, the sheet image for these blocks and items needs to contain a pre-drawn animation. The upside is that the animations will not be limited to these blocks, but can be used for any sheet image. Also, the game will allow texture packs to mix and match sheet image resolution. For example, if an HD texture pack is missing a certain sheet image, the game will be able to use the default one even though it has a different format (16x16 pixels). \n [ edit ] Installing a texture pack \n \n Download a texture pack from the site of your choice. Most texture packs are in ZIP file format, but as long as it has the necessary files (Pack.txt), Minecraft will recognize a folder as a texture pack. If you create your own textures, you can ZIP them if you feel it is necessary. For in-depth instructions on obtaining the files to make your own custom texture pack go to Tutorials/Custom Texture Packs . However this is not necessary, as of snapshot 12w23a, for as long as pack.txt exists, it will be recognized as a texture pack. \n Run Minecraft . If you already have Minecraft running, make sure you save and quit the world: you need to at least be in the main menu to continue. \n Click Texture Packs button. (If you do not see it, go to Options) \n Click Open Texture Pack Folder button; this will open the folder where Minecraft stores all texture packs. If nothing happens, you need to find the folder manually. Depending on your operating system it is: \n \n \n \n \n Windows XP/Vista/7/8: %appdata%\\.minecraft\\texturepacks \n GNU/Linux: ~/.minecraft/texturepacks (This folder may be hidden in the Home folder) \n Mac OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/texturepacks (This folder may be hidden) \n \n \n \n \n You do not have to have Minecraft closed to place the texture pack in the opened folder. \n In a few seconds the texture pack will appear in Minecraft . Select it and click "Done". The texture pack is now applied, you may load your world and see the difference. If Minecraft did not update, simply exit and reopen the texture packs screen. \n \n [ edit ] Installation tips \n \n Texture packs may redesign only some textures. So if the main menu looks the same after you select a pack, it doesn\'t mean the pack is not working. If you feel the menu needs to be changed, contact the author of the texture pack, unless you have created it, in which case you will need to modify the textures yourself. \n You may install many texture packs. The texture pack list can be scrolled by dragging the scrollbars up or down. \n Minecraft may lock the currently used texture pack (for example, if the pack contains custom textures for user interface), so the file can\'t be overwritten. If you need to update the pack, you may need to temporarily switch to the default pack and then overwrite the file. \n To get an unzipped directory to show as a texture pack in Minecraft , that directory needs a pack.txt in it. This, however, did not work prior to 12w23a. \n Keep in mind that, if you downloaded a texture pack in ZIP form, it may contain another folder inside of it that has the texture pack\'s title, this is the actual texture pack. In this case, you will need to either copy, cut, or drag this folder to the texture packs folder. \n If you have an older version of Minecraft (1.2.5 for example) and you install a Texture pack for a newer version, the texture pack will still run properly, and will ignore the unused items or blocks. \n An editor is a great way to make a texture pack. \n \n [ edit ] List of texture packs \n [ edit ] Native resolution (16px) \n \n Main article: Texture Packs/Native \n \n Click on the link above to see the list of native resolution texture packs. \n [ edit ] Low resolution (8px or lower) \n \n Main article: Texture Packs/Low \n \n Click on the link above to see the list of low resolution texture packs. Some packs may need a patcher. \n [ edit ] High resolution (32px or more) \n Note: Versions prior to 1.5 require a patcher, such as MCPatcher or Optifine, to display HD textures properly. Versions prior to Beta 1.8 will crash if you attempt to use an HD pack. \n \n Main article: Texture Packs/High \n \n [ edit ] Creating a texture pack \n \n Main article: Tutorials/Custom Texture Packs \n \n \n \n \n  \nWhat each image in terrain.png represents from Minecraft 1.4.5 to Minecraft 1.4.7 \n \n \n To create a custom texture pack, the files you wish to modify must be extracted from minecraft.jar with an archiving or decompression program such as 7-Zip or WinRAR . They can then be edited with any image editing program that can read/write the PNG file format and handle transparency. A program such as GIMP , Pixlr or Paint.NET will work well, as all of them are provided free of charge. Programs such as Microsoft Paint do not support transparency, and will replace transparent areas with color (or pure white), ruining the texture. An example of this is that ice will become a solid color. However, it is possible to create a texture pack using only paint in Windows. \n Edit each PNG file as desired, and save them as 32-bit PNG files to preserve transparency. Then, create a zip file of the modified files, preserving all of the original folder hierarchy, however this is not necessary. Any omitted file will be replaced by the default texture pack\'s version. If you find that nothing changes when you select your texture pack, make sure that the files are properly placed in the root of the zip (a common error is to place them within a folder in the zip, which will not work). \n [ edit ] Animated textures \n -&gt; Not supported in Version 1.6.x and later \n -&gt; 1.6.x uses a different format resembling a json-script \n \nIn Minecraft 1.5 or later, almost any block or item can be animated. Clocks, Compasses, Water, and Lava have special rules for animation (see Special Cases below). Animated textures require an additional .txt file to define the animation. The text file must have the same name as the image (such as "dirt.txt" for "dirt.png") . \n The format of the text file is simply numbers specifying which frames to pick (indices start from 0), separated by either commas or new lines. For example, if you would want to ping-pong an animation that has 4 frames, the contents of text file would look like this: \n \n0,1,2,3,2,1\n \n ... or like this: \n \n0\n1\n2\n3\n2\n1\n \n To make the animation slower than the default of 10 updates per second, the animation file can be specified to keep the frame for any number of ticks using an asterisk and the number of ticks to keep it. For example, to make the animation above four times slower, the file would look like this: \n \n0*4,1*4,2*4,3*4,2*4,1*4\n \n [ edit ] Special cases \n Water and Lava: The water, lava, and lava_flow textures all have default text files, which must be overwritten if you have an animation that varies from the default length of 32 frames for water and 16 frames for lava. The textures for flowing lava and water use 4 slots of the terrain texture. To simplify the construction of the artwork, these two sheet images are double the size of the other blocks in the texture pack (32x32 pixels for the default resolution). \n Compass: The compass cannot be animated, instead it will use its animation slots to render the direction of the needle. The compass can have any number of directions, but the first one (frame 0) should point south and the others should gradually turn clock-wise. Naturally, the last frame should almost point south again (slightly to the east). \n Clock: Like the compass, the clock cannot be animated. Its animation frames are used to render the time of day. The first frame is noon, then counting clock-wise a whole day. Midnight is at half of the animation\'s length (so if you have 32 frames for the clock, midnight should be at 16). \n [ edit ] List of modifiable files and folders \n \n \n File \n Description \n Notes \n \n \n pack.png \n Thumbnail of pack in texture selection list. \n Size should be 128x128 pixels. \n \n \n pack.txt \n Optional description of texture in pack selection list. \n Any text after the first 33 characters will not appear. \n \n \n particles.png \n All Particles \n The redstone particles\' color cannot be changed. \n \n \n terrain.png \n All blocks \n Since Beta 1.8, the chest has its own texture located in item/chest.png, (and item/largechest.png) similar to that of mobs.

The format separates each individual block texture into its own file. [1] The "unstitcher" tool can be downloaded here .\n \n A version both able to handle bigger texture packs, and to convert old-style animations (as used by Optifine and MCPatcher), is available here ( direct link ). (Dinnerbone approved) [2] \n \n \n The sheet images used in the in-development version of 13w02a can be found here: http://assets.minecraft.net/unstitcher/textures.zip Check here to see examples of the special images (such as lava and the compass). \n \n Mod textures can be found among their files in their downloaded zip/jar. Some looking around may be needed as mod folder structures can vary. (Please improve list.) \n [ edit ] Sharing and distributing \n Curse has made promoting your texture packs an ease with their new texture pack uploader . Doing so instantly enables anyone using the Curse client to easily install the texture pack; and also makes you eligible for the author rewards program . \n [ edit ] Obsolescence \n As of Snapshot 13w24a and later, Texture packs are no longer supported. They have been replaced with Resource packs . There is a tool that can be downloaded in order to convert Texture packs into Resource packs. See the Resource pack for more details. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n The selected texture pack is saved to the options.txt file in the .minecraft folder, so you can also manually change the "skin:" value to the name of the .zip. This can be useful if the texturepack crashes the main menu, thus making impossible to change the pack using the texture selection screen. Simply erase the pack name and it will be reset to default. \n Changing the dimensions of FoliageColor.png, GrassColor.png, or WaterColor.png (found in the \'misc\' folder) will cause a severe loading issue that causes world generation to be corrupt and switching to any other texture pack to cause a "saving chunks" crash. \n \n [ edit ] Resources \n \n An unofficial list of texture packs on the

[1] Realms servers can also have a whitelist. [2] Realms provide an easy and faster way to create Minecraft servers and allows more control for the creator. Minecraft Realms are not intended for large public servers but for groups of friends or as a family server. [3] \n Minecraft Realms have been in development since Minecon 2012 , when Mojang revealed that they wanted to host their own servers.Minecraft P.E has pocket realms supported by amazon and currently is a free limited version. \n About 100 players [4] were selected by a computer algorithm [5] to test the first publicly released version of Realms. [6] However, only active accounts were chosen among the random algorithm. \n The chosen players can create their own Minecraft worlds and invite up to 50 other players into their world, whether or not they were originally chosen to test. [7] Mojang have stated that they are not sure about the player limit once it is publicly released, however Daniel Frisk stated that it was "optimized to allow up to 10 people into the world." Only one server can be made at a time if hosting. Players that are invited will have the Realms option appear on the screen, which then the invited players can enter and explore the world they were invited in. \n Minecraft Realms will be hosted by Multiplay Gameservers on the PC and via Amazon for Pocket Edition . [8] \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Subscriptions \n 2 Settings \n 3 History \n 4 Trivia \n 5 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Subscriptions \n  \n Minecraft Realms is not free. Rather, players have to subscribe to use the feature. [9] The 100 beta testers have a subscription which lasts for 90 days. [10] [11] By viewing the language files [12] in Minecraft via an editor, these lines can be seen: \nmco.configure.world.buttons.subscription=Subscription \nmco.configure.world.subscription.title=Subscription Info \nmco.configure.world.subscription.daysleft=Days Left \nmco.configure.world.subscription.start=Start Date \nmco.configure.world.subscription.extend=Extend \n [ edit ] Settings \n  \n If you are one of the 100 beta testers, or have been invited to join a realm by a beta tester, you will see a Minecraft Realms button on the main menu screen. The "Minecraft Realms" button is in the same place as the "Texture Packs" button was before (removed earlier in 13w03a ). Clicking on it brings you to the screen above. The screen is very similar to that of the Multiplayer menu, with a few differences. \n \n \n Option \n Description \n \n \n Join Server \n Joins a realm. \n \n \n Create World \n Creates a realm \n \n \n Configure \n Opens the configuration menu \n \n \n More Info \n Opens realms.minecraft.net in your default browser. \n \n \n  \n Clicking on "Configure" brings you to the configuration menu. To the left, you have the Name and Description. To the right, you have a list of all the invited players. \n \n \n Option \n Description \n \n \n Edit \n Edits the name and the description of the Realm. \n \n \n Reset World \n Allows you to reset the world. Resetting a world permanently deletes the old one. There is also an option to put in a seed when creating a new world. \n \n \n Close World \n Closes the world. Selecting yes will make the world unavailable to other players. Closing a world is the equivalent of stopping a server. \n \n \n Subscription \n Tells you the start date of the subscription, and how many days are left. \n \n \n Invite \n Invites a player to your realm. Type in the player\'s name to give that player access to your realm. The other player will then see your realm in menu. \n \n \n Uninvite \n Uninvites a player from your realm. \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 13w09b \n Added Minecraft Realms. \n \n \n Only accessible to 100 beta testers. \n \n \n 13w11a \n a few Minecraft Realms changes. \n \n \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n The Mojang blog closing signature was signed // The Minecraft and Minecraft Realms teams instead of the usual // The Minecraft team starting with the blog Minecraft Snapshot 13w09a .

It is based on the already existing Pocket Edition but is slightly cut down, containing a revised feature set and support for multiple programming languages. The Pi Edition is intended as an educational tool for novice programmers. It is available to download for free, from the official downloads page and users are encouraged to open and change the game\'s code using its API . [2] \n It is being developed by Aron Nieminen - one of the developers of the Pocket Edition , as well as Daniel Frisk .

[4] \n There was a compiled build labelled 0.1 on the Mojang repository, albeit encrypted until the game\'s launch in February of 2013, making it inaccessible. When it was first uploaded, however, it was unprotected for a short amount of time, allowing for the download of the game before its true release. On December 20, 2012, Mojang released a post on their official site announcing the release of the Pi Edition . However, it was promptly removed and no game release was made. \n Minecraft: Pi Edition was publicly released on February 11, 2013, and the previous release announcement post was restored. [5] However, the Pi Edition website still lists its post date as December 20, 2012. [6] \n [ edit ] Gameplay \n Minecraft Pi Edition is very similar to Pocket Edition in many ways. Like Pocket Edition, there are still barrier walls, the player skin is always the default skin, and the title screen and the world selection screen are the same. There are also blue Roses, like in Pocket Edition. So far there is only Creative mode available. The player has various blocks and items only seen in Pocket Edition, like, The Nether Reactor Core, and the Stone Cutter. \n The player has the ability to sneak, but not sprint. Currently, there is no mob spawning, even though the player starts with an Iron Sword in hand. The Bow is also available, but when used, the player will hold the Bow back infinitely until the player selects another item or logs off. \n [ edit ] Version history \n \n Main article: Pi Edition

Upside-down slabs occupy the top half of their block space rather than the bottom half. To place a slab upside-down, right-click on the bottom of a "ceiling" block, which can be removed after the slab has been placed, or by right clicking the top half of another block, if the player wishes to place it on the side of another double or single slab block. \n All types of "stone" slab have the same data values ; like wood and colored wool , they are differentiated by their damage values: stone slabs have a damage value of 0, sandstone slabs has 1, old wooden slabs has 2 (which were actually stone, and are still obtainable), cobblestone slabs has 3, bricks has 4, stone bricks has 5, and nether bricks has 6. Damage value 7 is occupied by nether quartz, and formerly by a smooth variant of the stone slab. Upside down stone slabs have a damage value of 8, sandstone has 9, wooden has 10, cobblestone has 11, bricks has 12, stone bricks has 13, nether bricks has 14, and nether quartz has 15. Real wood slabs use a different set of block and damage values. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Obtaining \n \n 1.1 Natural Occurrence \n 1.2 Crafting \n \n \n 2 Usage \n \n 2.1 As a crafting ingredient \n \n \n 3 Behavior \n 4 Video \n 5 History \n \n 5.1 Dirt slab \n \n \n 6 Issues \n 7 Trivia \n 8 Gallery \n 9 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Obtaining \n [ edit ] Natural Occurrence \n Stone slabs can be found naturally in NPC Villages lining the roof of a blacksmith shop and inside some of the buildings where they form counters. They are also found in Strongholds where they are used in some of the stairs, ledges and torch pillars. Sandstone slabs can be found naturally in desert wells and desert temples . \n [ edit ] Crafting \n Unlike many wooden items, wooden slabs must be crafted entirely from one type of wood, but by the same token, they keep the type (and color) of the wood used, thus "Birch Wood Slabs" and so forth. \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Stone , \n Sandstone , \n Cobblestone , \n Bricks , \n Stone Brick , \n Wood Planks , \n Nether Brick , or \n Block of Quartz \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n   6  \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Usage \n [ edit ] As a crafting ingredient \n \n \n Ingredients \n Input&#160;\xc2\xbb Output \n \n \n Sandstone Slabs or \nQuartz Slabs \n \n \n \n   \n   \n   \n \n    \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n   \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Glass + \n Nether Quartz + \n Wooden Slabs \n \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n    \n    \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Behavior \n \n \n \n  \nAn example of how upside-down slabs can make compact redstone "stairs". \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nSlabs do not block a vertical redstone connection. \n \n \n Like other partial blocks slabs are treated as a whole block by other blocks, such as dirt , stone, and glass , and liquids . Two slabs of the same type (e.g. two stone slabs) can be placed one on top of one another to make a single full-size block, but different slab types cannot be mixed in this way. Sandstone, wooden, and cobblestone double-slabs look exactly the same as their full block counter-parts, but take a longer time to break and drop two slabs. Wooden slabs are collected more quickly with an axe and are flammable. \n Single slabs have the tendency to let through arrows shot from above. They will also destroy gravel and sand blocks that fall onto them (the same as torches , as long as the slab is a bottom-half). They are also treated as transparent by the game and can cause suffocation , prevent placement of torches or other fixtures on them and chests with single slabs above them can still be opened. \n An unusual property of slabs is that they are non-solid to redstone . This allows redstone wiring to be hidden underneath while still being able to connect to the wire on the side of the slabs. \n Mobs can spawn on top of upside down slabs and on double slabs. \n Due to the way blast rays propagate from an explosion slabs provide extremely effective absorption to explosions directly on top of them. Specifically, this is because explosive entities will be lower in elevation when they explode on top of slabs than they would otherwise be on an ordinary block. Although the few slab(s) directly under the explosion will absorb the full force of the blast (with a resistance of 30) as usual, the propagation of damage to the sides will be greatly reduced. If source of the explosion is elevated for any reason at the time of the blast, this protective quirk is lost. \n Despite how sneaking lowers the player\'s eye level half a block, doing so does not allow the player to walk over a single slab with one block of air above it because of the player\'s true height. A player cannot walk from a block of soul sand to a slab without jumping. \n [ edit ] Video \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n Classic \n \n \n October 24, 2009 \n Stone slabs were introduced to the game on October 24, 2009, in Classic Survival Test 0.27 . \n \n \n In Classic and Survival Test , stone slabs could be obtained by mining Coal Ore because of the lack of inventory and crafting . \n \n \n Stone slab blocks were called stair blocks before the current stairs were added; after this, they were known as steps (the two forms being single steps and double steps ) before all items got official names upon the Beta release. \n \n \n Beta \n \n \n 1.3 \n Added sandstone, wooden, and cobblestone slabs. \n \n \n Before the additional slabs were added, a double stone slab would only yield one slab when broken. Since this update, all double slabs yield 2 of their respective single slabs when broken. Destroying double slabs with TNT , however, still only yields single slabs (when the slabs aren\'t simply destroyed by the explosion ). \n \n \n Before Beta 1.3 came out, stone slabs were made with cobblestone instead of stone, but this update introduced cobblestone slabs to the game and changed the recipes for pressure plates and stone slabs so that there wouldn\'t be any conflicting recipes. \n \n \n 1.8 \n Added the stone brick, bricks, and smooth full half-slab. (Smooth full half-slab was only obtainable through inventory editing at the time.) \n \n \n The sprinting feature was added in this update. While stairs stop the player\'s sprinting, slabs allow a player to continue sprinting. \n \n \n Official release \n \n \n 1.2 Preview \n All types of slabs can now be placed upside down and under blocks; these occupy the top half of their block space rather than the bottom half. \n \n \n Before 1.2, slabs had a 2:1 input/output ratio, i.e. 3 cobblestone would get you only 3 slabs out of the current 6. This is likely due to the fact that the slab types are differentiated by their damage values instead of by different data values , similar to wood , coal or charcoal , and colored wool . \n \n \n 1.3.1 \n 12w17a \n \n \n \n \n  \nA wooden slab house with a netherrack fireplace using the old wooden oak/"stone" slab trick, allowing the fire to be contained. \n \n \n New slabs were added for the four different types of wooden planks , replacing the old wooden oak/"stone" slab. The new slabs were vulnerable to fire, but could now be collected faster with an axe instead of a pickaxe. The old wooden slabs did not burn and could only be collected with a pickaxe because they were the same block and shared the same data value as other slabs, except with a different texture. This caused wooden slabs to break faster with a pickaxe rather than an axe. Wooden slabs were also are not affected by fire and had a stronger blast resistance than wooden planks, which made them a useful building material. These properties could be used in SMP to help prevent griefing , and the fact that wooden slabs didn\'t burn also made it useful for creating houses in The Nether ; but since the update, they can no longer be safely used. The original wooden oak/"stone" slab can still be obtained through inventory editing or the /give command. Wooden slabs already crafted or placed in the world remain the old \'stone\' type. \n \n \n \n All four wooden upside-down slabs had the oak plank texture. \n \n \n 12w18a \n Fixed upside down slabs having same texture. \n \n \n 12w25a \n Redstone (including repeaters, torches, levers, and pressure plates) and rails can now be placed on slabs and stairs positioned upside down. \n \n \n 12w26a \n Mobs can now spawn on upside down slabs. \n \n \n 1.4.2 \n 12w39a \n \n \n \n \n  \nupside-down slab lighting bug \n \n \nSlabs interact properly with lighting now; when slabs are placed upside down, they now accept light from light sources themselves, and no longer block light to surrounding blocks; they no longer cast the shadow of a full-sized block. [1] \n \n \n Smooth lighting on slabs is slightly bugged. \n \n \n November 28, 2012 \n Jeb tweeted a picture of himself crafting netherbrick slabs. [2] \n \n \n 1.4.6 \n 12w49a \n Added nether brick slabs, which causes the smooth full half-slab to change its damage value to 43:7 \n \n \n 1.5 \n 13w02a \n Added quartz slabs. The formerly unused slab type, known as the smooth full half-slab (see gallery), was removed from the game. Its data values were replaced with the nether quartz slab. \n \n \n January 22, 2013 \n Jeb states that the smooth full half-slab will be re-implemented with a value of 43:8. The smooth sandstone slab will also be implemented, with a value of 43:9. He also stated that they may be obtained legitimately later. [3] \n \n \n 1.5 \n 13w04a \n The smooth full half-slab is re-implemented with a value of 43:8. The smooth sandstone slab is also added, with a value of 43:9. \n \n \n [ edit ] Dirt slab \n \n \n \n  \nThe dirt slab, replacing all the dirt (not grass ) blocks. \n \n \n Before stone slabs were added to 0.26, Notch ran a test of dirt slabs. They were never added to the actual game and were only mentioned once. [4] They replaced all dirt blocks and did not grow grass on top. \n [ edit ] Issues \n Issues relating to "Slabs" are maintained on Mojira. Report issues there. \n [ edit ] Trivia \n \n \n \n  \nLight passing through the sides of a brick slab from above. A normal block would render complete darkness. \n \n \n \n An unused slab type, known as the "smooth full half-slab", has a data value of 43 7 , but can only be obtained with /give or an inventory editor. It is a full block with the top texture of stone slabs on all six sides. As of 13w04a , the data value is 43 8 and a similar effect with sandstone can be obtained with 43 9 . See the gallery for a comparison image. \n Before version 13w05a stairs prevented sprinting. Since slabs did not they were used in place of stairs. They were also used to keep floors from catching on fire. \n In the Pocket Edition , wooden slabs are treated as stone slabs and must be mined with a pickaxe. This characteristic of slabs existed in outdated versions of Minecraft PC. \n Since the Beta light update, slabs now let a small amount of light pass through their edges. This light is only visible with Smooth Lighting turned on, and does not affect mob spawning or other light-dependent processes.\n \n The exception of this is that any light directed through a slab does not affect any block\'s light values north of the source. \n \n \n When a slab is placed on top of ice , the slab has the same "slipperiness" as the ice below it. This applies to every other block with a hit-box that is lesser than a full block. \n If slabs are placed below TNT, it will significantly reduce their damage. By making a floor of slabs, the TNT will lower its explosive power to two blocks instead of six. This is so because the TNT believes that it is inside the slab, for the game thinks that it is inside a full block, greatly reducing its explosion radius. \n Stone slabs are the only slab which, when stacked, do not mimic their block in texture. \n You can sneak walk off slabs at ground level. \n Minecarts on powered rails will not be repelled from a slab. They will, however, be repelled by a slab with a minecart on top. \n Though the new wooden slabs are flammable, the old wooden oak/"stone" slab is still available through inventory editing or the /give command, so in a world/server where commands are allowed, it is still possible to obtain fireproof wooden slabs. \n When Creepers explode on stone slabs they only destroy the slab they were standing on and nothing else in the area. \n It is possible to get any type of double slab that you want by using the /give command and typing in /give (player) 43 1 (slab id). This will allow you to build faster. \n If you type in /give &lt;player&gt; 43 1 10, then it will give you a wooden plank, but it acts like a stone block. It is not flammable and it makes "stone" sound effects when they are placed, broken, or stepped on. This is the version of the wood slab that was used for old slabs when wood slabs were made flammable. \n If redstone dust is placed on an upside-down slab, it will not trigger adjacent TNT. \n If you set a slab on the top half side of any block under water, it will displace as much of it as a whole block. Not only can you grab a quick breath of air, but you can see as clear through the water as looking over the land above the surface than in it itself. \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n

Jeb took the position following Minecraft\'s release and Notch , former lead developer, stepping down. [3] On December 13, 2012, he announced that as of that day, he was the lead programmer of the Pocket Edition . [4] He has his own website for his indie games. Jeb frequents the Minecraft Wiki as Jeb , [5] where he was particularly active in the issue lists , which he sanctioned as the official place to report and discuss Minecraft bugs and annoyances. Jeb\'s Minecraft account is jeb_ . \n Starting out as a back-end developer for Scrolls , Jeb became increasingly involved in the development of Minecraft , implementing features like wolves , pistons , and map structures ( villages , strongholds and nether fortresses ). As of May 2012, his tweets now appear on the homepage of minecraft.net , in place of Notch\'s. \n In 2013, he was included in the annual TIME 100 list along with Notch. [6] \n If you look in the Scrolls trailer, Jeb is called gingerwithasoul. He was once called this on Mojang\'s blog. \n Games \n \n Minecraft - Lead developer \n Scrolls - Back-end developer \n Cobalt - A platformer in developement. \n Strategist - Turn-based strategy game

It was developed by Zachtronics Industries , and released in steps of incremental updates during April\xe2\x80\x93May 2009. It quickly garnered a following on message boards around the internet, and inspired Notch to start working on Minecraft several weeks after it was discontinued. Like Minecraft , Infiniminer is a block -based digging/building game. It was originally intended to be played as a team-based competitive game, where the goal is to locate and excavate precious metals, and bring your findings to the surface to earn points for your team. However, as the game gained popularity, players decided it was much more fun to build things than to compete for points. Zachtronics discontinued development of the game less than a month after its first release. The source code was un-obfuscated, which resulted in many hackers creating hacked clients, and others who were unhappy with balancing to fork, causing it to fatally lose coherence. \n [ edit ] References \n \n The origins of Minecraft - The Word of Notch. \n Zach Barth stating why Infiniminer failed . \n Infiniminer on the English Wikipedia . \n \n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://www.minecraftwiki.net/index.php?title=Infiniminer&amp;oldid=503008 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Category : Community  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \t    \n\t\t\t\t    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n\t\t Log in / create account \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Page \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Minecraft Wiki \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Projects \n\t\t\t Wiki rules \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Random page \n\t\t\t Admin noticeboard \n\t\t\t Directors page \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Minecraft \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Website \n\t\t\t Forums \n\t\t\t Mojang blog \n\t\t\t Issue tracker \n\t\t\t Facebook page \n\t\t\t YouTube channel \n\t\t\t Steam community \n\t\t\t Minecraft Museum \n\t\t\t Server list \n\t\t\t Classic server list \n\t\t\t IRC \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Useful pages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Blocks \n\t\t\t Items \n\t\t\t Crafting \n\t\t\t Enchanting \n\t\t\t Brewing \n\t\t\t Mobs \n\t\t\t Redstone circuit \n\t\t\t Resource pack \n\t\t\t Mods \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t In other languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Deutsch \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Nederlands \n\t\t\t \xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9 \n\t\t\t \xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87 \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t      \n   \t     \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t     \n             \n      \n       Recent Community Articles \n       \n      \n     \n             \t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             \n      \n       Mojang Tweets \n       Getting your tweets... \n\n      \n     \n        \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 8 July 2013, at 18:41. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Content is available under CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Privacy policy \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t About Minecraft Wiki \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Disclaimers \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n      \n       \n       &copy; 2006-2013 Curse, Inc.
