Also if guys are the jelous type they might be so mad if they see a guy trying to talk to you and the guy might be only your friend or the girl might be only your friend to. I have seen so many relationship flush down the toilet just because they had problem because of facebook.One day i saw my friend put on facebook that she had problem with her boyfriend and that comment that she put created more problems. I use my facebook to talk to friend anfd put things but i always see twice or three times on what i put on facebook. "
